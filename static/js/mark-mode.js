/**
 * Knockoff/joke off of "dark mode." Mark mode dots all the i's in text nodes with a famous Mark:
 * Mark Zuckerburg, Marc Maron, Mark Cuban, Mark from The Room, Marc Andreesonâ€¦
 *
 * The technical implementation will happen in a few steps:
 *
 * - Find all the `i`'s or `j`'s in text nodes and wrap them in a <span class="mark-i"><span class="mark-dot-x"></span>i</span>
 * - The (x) will be randomly generated within a range, each will have a different value for offset in a spritesheet.
 * - mark-dot-x will float on top, with a high z-index so it's "in front of" the lower i
 *
 * Since the rest is happening in CSS and the spritesheet, the main responsibility of this function is to edit the
 * DOM. It travels the whole damn thing and wraps all text nodes in new <span>s, so it's not, like, efficient.

   *
   * Note that the naive way to do this is with global regex replace; unfortunately, this leads to you using the
   * same Mar[kc] for the entire text node. The better thing to do is use a random Mar[ck] for each instance of `i`, which
   * can happen multiple times in a text node.
   *
   * Therefore, we're doing a nasty little state-tracking runaround the string. This is a bit like a whiteboard
   * interview problem in 2009, where you'd mangle indices around a string.
   *
   * Also, turns out most elements that haven't been HTML minified have tabs and spaces as children; we just
   * return in those instances rather than create new <spans>
