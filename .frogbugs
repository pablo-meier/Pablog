* Doesn't accept Markdown lists that's indented by < 3 spaces.

* Doesn't accept a post that ends in a Markdown list (unresolved references, looks like).

* Multiline backtick causes it to freak out (i.e. `[paul,robert,
annalisa]` doesn't do what I hoped it would).

* Multiline lists aren't parsed correctly, it ends after the \n, not after processing what comes next.

* Surprise! Multiline hyperlinks are broken.

* Parenthesis after a references link (e.g. "[something][1] (aside...)") is broken.

* Clean doesn't remove autogenerated non-posts, like the dirs, or the About page.
