* Port the Liquid video tags with a Racket script.
* Clean the footer.
* Add pictures of you.
* Write Engineering/Performance.
* Performance on requests for render speed. (Ilya's talks, minify + combine requests).
* FIX MARKDOWN


Tag the things, formatting, images (clean the posts).
--> Long tail. Would be nice to bug track. Would be even better to just fix Markdown for some of it.

Clean directory structure
* Things sit at top-level, a dotfile handles excludes from rysnc, a clean
  script has to handle what stays and what goes. Consolidate to a clean src/
  and dst/ directory, maybe fix Frog so `clean` works.
* Also, a clean 'build' command means you could do things like minify + consolidate requests at build-time

TeX algo for line-breaking?
--> Hard for now -- doesn't play with formatting (even bold or italics), freaks out in lists.
--> Would need to integrate with the Markdown parser on some level.

- Polish
Prettify it a bit?
"read more" as a default, so essays don't take up everything.
