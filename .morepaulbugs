Old liquid links (vimeo, Youtube) borken.
--> Could port Liquid (ew), or just do a clean scrippt in the meantime.

Performance -- look again at Ilya's talk, see how to make requests short, minify+combine all files.

Tag the things, formatting, images (clean the posts).
--> Long tail. Would be nice to bug track. Would be even better to just fix Markdown for some of it.

Clean directory structure
--> Things sit at top-level, a dotfile handles excludes from rysnc, a clean
    script has to handle what stays and what goes. Consolidate to a clean src/
    and dst/ directory, maybe fix Frog so `clean` works.

TeX algo for line-breaking?
--> Hard for now -- doesn't play with formatting (even bold or italics), freaks out in lists.
--> Would need to integrate with the Markdown parser on some level.

Prettify it a bit?
Search function, a la Jekyll?
