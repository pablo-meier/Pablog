Clean directory structure
* Minify, inline, consolidate requests.
** Happen from Frog:
*** Before we render the template, we go through it
**** Find all <link rel="stylesheet">
**** Consolidate all CSS files into a single one in the order they were defined.
**** Inline it AFTER Scribble parsing has happened so as not to confuse @media things.

**** Find all <script src="">
**** Consolidate them into a single minified request, insert at bottom of DOM.

* Performance on requests for render speed. (Ilya's talks, minify + combine requests).
* Add pictures of you.
* FIX MARKDOWN (mdtest?)

* Tag the things, formatting, images (clean the posts).
--> Long tail. Would be nice to bug track. Would be even better to just fix Markdown for some of it.

* Linkcheck support

* Custom download of Bootstrap without all the things you don't use?

TeX algo for line-breaking?
--> Hard for now -- doesn't play with formatting (even bold or italics), freaks out in lists.
--> Would need to integrate with the Markdown parser on some level.

- Polish
* Redesign sidebar?

Builder

Check for built pages, choose to build them or not as necessary. Probably require you
to "libraryfy" Frog.
