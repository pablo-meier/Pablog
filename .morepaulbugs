* Add pictures of you.

* Tag the things, formatting, images (clean the posts).
** Would be nice to bug track. See what the Markdown do-over gets you.

* Linkcheck support built-in, fix broken links.

* Custom download of Bootstrap without all the things you don't use? Need to build somehow with Readability theme.

* Redesign sidebar?
