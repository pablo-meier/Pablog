# Content

* Titles only list or 'greatest hits' on frontpage, like Evan Miller's blog. Personal statements too.
* Audit RSS feed

# Features and shit.

"Hey this is old" post
linkable paragraphs (each `p` gets an `id`, hover exposes link)
Discourse?
'Versioned' pages, where you can sustain the pages after edits, with links to those edits?
TeX algo for line-breaking?
