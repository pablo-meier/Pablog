# Pablog!

Repo for [personal blog][3], generated with [Frog][1]. It'sâ€¦ not updated and/or
as technically cool as it should be, for a Professional Software Developer.

Much of the final output is a bit wonky since Markdown is [very poorly defined,][4]
meaning the [Markdown][2] parser that Frog uses behaves a differently than the one
Jekyll uses (most of this was done before [CommonMark][7] was a thing. To make
matters worse, many of these posts come from the an export of my old
[Blogger site][5], which output yet another idea of what Markdown should be.

Building it sucks, but I'm making it better! You need [Racket][9], to get
[Frog][8], to build it in `build/` then you have to copy `static` into that. The
single-task Makefile does this.

I eschewed Docker; we push to S3 now.
