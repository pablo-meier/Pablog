# Engineering Interviews

Nobody likes them, and most people I respect don't believe they're good
indicators of success on the job. It's a set of ceremonies we all perform to
collectively convince ourselves:

> i‚Äôm kidding myself‚Äîno-one hires senior engs, they hire friends ‚Äî [tef][1]

Navigating this on either side is a bear.üêª Here are a bunch of links that help
me most in making sense to this (a lot of them taken from when [I did a round in
2016][2], but I'll keep this one updated).

Part of what makes interviews such a weird and painful process is the lack of
clarity on expectations for the hire and what success looks like in the process.
Clarifying our thoughts is hard! Humans generally amble through life and want
things to feel good without applying intention behind it; if you can invest some
time, you'll have a much better idea of what you're shooting for.  

I found these helpful on getting clarity.

* Ann Harter [wrote and expanded on][24] a fabulous series of tweets on how to
  _engineer_ a tech interview using SCIENCE. Most processes are cargo-culted
  from what Big Companies do or what we ourselves have been subjected to,
  without much critical examination; it's especially jarring when tiny startups
  that build boring apps _insist!_ you hire someone who can write code fit for a
  space shuttle.<br /><br /><small>Pssst‚Ä¶ past a certain point, the writing of
  your code is probably not what the success of your business hinges on.</small>

* Peter Seibel, likely inspired by the above bullet point, published a Gist of
  [what he wants in a candidate.][23] If you're looking to hire: on which do you
  agree? Is your process hitting some/any of those points? How?

* Lara Hogan's [Onsite Interview Loop Template][29] is also worth reading
  through and trying at your org.

Our industry sucks at including people. I like these articles for including that
perspective when considering how to run and approach interviews at a high
level.

* Cate Huston's [_How I Interview_][18] is pretty fabulous, as is her [_Things
  You Don't Learn In Technical Interviews_][19]. She also wrote [_this essay for
  Model View Culture_][20]. She's one of my favorite people to blog on tech and
  the industry, and hiring is no exception.

* I think diversity matters. Most Engineering teams are terrible at it. Carlos
  Bueno has written wonderfully about it on [_Inside the Mirrortocracy_][21] and
  [_Refactoring the Mirrortocracy_][22].


A few more in terms of execution:

* An excellent treatment of mistakes made during phone screens by Jocelyn
  Goldfein is [here][26].

* I find a lot to like in Dan Luu's [_Developer hiring and the market for
  lemons_][27] and [_We only hire the best means we only hire the
  trendiest_][28].
