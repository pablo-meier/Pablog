# Donuts

[Lara Hogan][1] has [a very lovely tradition][2] of celebrating her career
achievements with donuts. I love donuts! And I like being reminded to celebrate!

I never commemorated them online, but I've been doing things like donuts for
minor wins. I'll commemorate as many as I can here, the earlier ones are
retroactive.
