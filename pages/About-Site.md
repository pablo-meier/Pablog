# About (this site)

This website is built a bit atypically; and while I think this bores a ton of 
people, hopefully others will find it interesting!

## Current

### Content

The repo for the site is hosted on GitHub [here][3]. It's a generated static
site, which has some nice perks:

* I can version control the content. I can push it to GitHub, Bitbucket, and/or
  ZIP it and push it to Google Drive. I've lost a website or two in my time,
  this is something even I can't fuck up.

* Generated sites are extremely cheap to host: putting it on S3 costs me a
  single-digit number of dollars a month.

* If I have a question or edit to make, I can use command-line tools (i.e. find
  all instances I've used a word, feed this into a Markov chain, or somesuch).

I'm using a tool I wrote myself, ([Fleaswallow][49]). Before Fleaswallow, I used
other engines:

* [Frog][4], by Greg Hendershott. Greg also wrote [the best damn Scheme Macro
  tutorial ever,][8] and I love supporting [Racket.][7]

* Jekyll, but its original author [heinously mismanaged GitHub][6] and was a
  petulant little asshole about his deservedly shameful exit. I'll follow
  [Julie's advice][5] and not associate with him or his work if I can help it.

I've [written before][9] about various other blogging engines and approaches
I've used over the years, and while I think my preference, from a user
experience, is for a self-hosted out-of-the-box system like [Ghost][10], its
generally not worth the trouble of migrating at this point ðŸ˜›

I use a few scripts on top of Racket to manage things:

* A [simple shell script][39] to publish the built site to AWS via CloudFront.
* A [command here and there][40] in a Makefile around the Fleaswallow commands.
* A [tool to facilitate image uploads][41]. Also in OCaml, I might find a way
  to integrate it with Fleaswallow. More in [the README.][42]

### Hosting

Being a static site, it's comparably easy to host this in S3. I use a full AWS
stack of S3, CloudFront, and Route 53. A decent guide to do this is [here][32].

Note that if you want to add [HSTS][37] with this stack, it's a bit more
cumbersome than using CloudFlare as I did before, when I was hosting this on a
running nginx container. Julia Evans [explains the basics of the tech here][34],
and this post [explains how to do it in the AWS stack here][35]. If you're
feeling so empowered, check your site on [Mozilla Observatory][36].

Comments were something of A Decision, I ended up using [Discourse][50] with
[embedded topics][51]. The main other contender was [Talk][52], as part of
[The Coral Project][53]. If you're looking for a purely static solution, you can
also look at [Staticman][54].

The Discourse instance is hosted on Digital Ocean, because the prices for the
compute looked comparable and their interface is just a whole lot nicer.

### Styles

The backbone of this aesthetic comes from [Best Motherfucking Website][43], part
of a family of sites I mentioned [here.][44]

That said, I do add images to most posts, and I'm adding styles/nav back. I am
committed to keeping this site pretty simple. Avoiding JS makes your sites
automatically

* Render fast, even in terrible network conditions
* No blink render
* Declarative (HTML doesn't throw an exception)
* Search-indexable
* Accessible
* Semantic + "View Source"-able
* Battery friendly

### Perf

If you run a site, there's a good chance you can find something you didn't know
by running it through [Google's PageSpeed Insights][12] and [Google's
Mobile-Friendly Test][13]. There's also [Lighthouse][45].

One of my favorite people in the space of site performance is [Ilya
Grigorik][25], so I highly recommend checking out his stuff.

This, as the previous section, is _massive_ overengineering for this pathetic
little site, but then you may just smile a bit wider when you look in the mirror
in the morning ðŸ˜„

### Accessibility

I'm pretty new to this, but it's a good idea to run your sites through something
like [a11y][26], [AChecker][27], or [WAVE][28]. [a11y Project][29] has some
great resources as well.

## Historical

More Pablo used to be More Paul, and it's had a lot of different iterations.
None of this applies anymore, but is worth storytelling value, and/or if you
have questions for your own sites.

### Content

My first blog was [this LiveJournal][46] I started freshman year of college. I
can't remember the login details, and don't have access to the email addresses
that they pointed to. It's a shame, there were a few "followers-only" posts (and
a few private ones) so some of it is Just Lost.

In college while learning computers, WordPress was taking off, so I hosted the
original "More Paul" as a WordPress install on a host I can't remember. Internet
Archive [caught a few of the pages][47], though I can't say I miss them much.

I lost that account on the host after my credit card expired and all their
warnings were Spam collected. The experience of the last two blogs might be
why, in part, I really appreciate static sites (and how easy it is to `git
commit && git push` them to the cloud).

### Hosting

After the above and I switched to static sites, I put my files into a
[Linode][48]. It was probably the simplest stack I've run until I landed back on
S3.

Two years ago, as containers were blowing up, I thought I'd learn them with this
site. The most ridiculous thing I ever did was host this on Google Cloud (my old
team!) using Kubernetes. I can't say I came out of that _particularly_
proficient with these technologies, but it was a fun experience.

If you're not doing your DNS through Amazon, it's pretty nice to use
[CloudFlare][11], especially for easy SSL. There [might be drawbacks to
this][24], however.

### Styles

I read the [CSS book by the authors][16] way back in 2006, when blue beanies
were a thing and "web standards" was still something of a fight (such was my
perception, anyways, it might have just been great branding by Zeldman and Meyer
and co.). Which is to say, I knew what CSS _looked_ like and `float`
was probably the most advanced property I remembered (that, and that to center
something dynamically, was `margin: 10px auto;`).

So when I was rebuilding the site, I was looking at other sources and more or
less losing my mind. Has science gone too far? What is this [text-rendering][17]
property? [vh][18] as a length descriptor?!?

It was all very humbling. I did some more traditional styling, archived [here][39]
and [here][38]. I got those by applying this basic process:

* Look at the default Ghost template, Casper. Good demonstration/style-test
  [here][20]. They kindly annotated/explained [its CSS file][21].

* [Some text things to keep in mind][22], re: text on blogs.

I found [this guide][19] (part two [here][23]) a pretty great read on these
topics, too.

Frog uses Bootstrap by default; I went with [Foundation][33] since I knew it
better. Now I'm trying to stay off both.

## In Conclusion

Use Squarespace.
