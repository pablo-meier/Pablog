Often when coding and confronted by a problem you don't know how to solve, it's
nice to have music that's fun/good/comfortable enough to tune the world out, but
not one that will overtake you.  Here's a bunch of YouTube links that I bounce
between.

I'm not familiar with stop-motion used in music, but the tune is excellent
(especially after playing hundreds of hours of Smash in the Zelda Palace level).
This guy makes excellent videos:

My favorite Zelda song on Guatemala's national instrument!

I'm just old enough to a remember a time before having Internet.  What a dark
time _that_ was.
