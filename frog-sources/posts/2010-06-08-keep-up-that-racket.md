    Title: Keep Up that Racket!

PLT Scheme, formerly my favorite Scheme implementation and [mentioned][1]
[before][2] in my writings, [has been re-branded][3] as [Racket][4]. I'm very
excited about this: Racket is a language of unbelievable potential, and
hopefully it's re-branding will make people aware of this.

(while it is just a name change and new website, I doubt Clojure would have
gotten it's momentum if it were just called "JVM Lisp").

One of the wonderful things about Racket is its mailing list, and a cute
discussion there generated a major treasure. Namely, someone brought up that
computer programming isn't really that related to computer science, to which
someone else mentioned that you could very much be a successful programmer
even if you haven't studied the science.

This is sadly true (many people making their livings [don't know][5] [what
they're doing][6], many examples at [The Daily WTF][7]), but then a user named
Joe Marshall simply wins:

>> It's quite possible to be a productive and successful programmer without

>without having a solid understanding of aerodynamics."
>
>'Rocket Scientist' : 'Newtonian physics'
>
>'Brain Surgeon' : 'neurology'

I attribute this more to the fact that [we're living in the cave-writing
stages of software][8]: we've had computers for fewer than 70 years, personal
computers for maybe 30, and connectivity for less. I'm sure after the
invention of the steam engine, all sorts of idiots were designing inefficient,
dangerous factories, and we've now got the software equivalent.


I'm lucky in that I got to study the science, and am genuinely interested in
it to keep learning. But what a wonderful day when people who develop software
who know at least what I do will come standard.
