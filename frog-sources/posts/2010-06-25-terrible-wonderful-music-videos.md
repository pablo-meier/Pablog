Here's a bunch.  The first is probably the most cringe-worthy.  This is why the terrorists hate us.

Here's another:

Now for some non-crappy ones.

Embedding disabled by request, so you'll have to [follow the link][1] for the
first one. It's a group called Skindred my former housemate showed me, a group
that combines reggae and metal, of all things. I think it works pretty well
here.

This one is _awful_, but I _love_ it:

"El Sonidito" means "the little sound." To quote my brother, who showed it to
me: "You need to play this at your next party. I've never seen a cooler bunch
of moderately looking guys. Also, I've never seen anyone look so cool playing
one note on the cheap keyboard."

The funny/sad thing is, this took off and got way popular. They made a ["real"
music video][2] with actors, a plot, unexplainable Hot Dancing Women... and it
sucks. I like the other one so much better.

On this blog's [theme of][3] [remixes][4], we've got a great, Bootsie-sounding
one of Mr. Plow:

When I first heard this, I was underwhelmed. They [were on the Colbert
Report][5] (as their record is released by Comedy Central, and what better way
to promo them?). Still, after a bunch of listens, it's pretty hip:

Finally, we'll round out this tour with a little Pitbull, lest we get too
classy:

It's more there as a contrast; I sometimes forget what machismo pop culture is
like. Also, it's damn catchy.

(I wanted to make a PL parody of this. "[Miranda][6] she gets LAZY,
[Haskell][7] it is LAZY, the [Bash Shell][8] it is LAZY, [Clean language][9]
it is LAZY,..., Now [thunk it][10] let's get LAZY, thunk it let's get
LAZY...").

**UPDATE (6/26/2010):** This one, in the 'awful' category, comes from Saurya,
though I find it much less an offender than the first two:

I would also place this in less-than-wildly-lame, only moderately-lame-but-
lovably-comical! It's dubiously dubbed Crabcore since they stand like crabs to
look hardcore. Gotta love the sweet Techno Dance Hall interlude near the end.
