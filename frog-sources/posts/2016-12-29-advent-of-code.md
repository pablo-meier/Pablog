A co-worker linked a few of us to [Advent of Code][1], a coding challenge that
released a new puzzle every day for December, leading to the 25th.

[I participated][2] as best I could, with a twist: try to write every day's
solution in a different programming language. I didn't finish (some explanation
follows), but I'm proud of my entries. The list of languages is:

Some things left to do:

* Finish the challenges. I'm missing Part 2 on Days 19 and 22, and all of days
  23, 24, and 25.

* Clean up the challenges. Originally I'd hoped to always use file input rather
  than hard-code some inputs, but that went by the wayside. Furthermore, I think
  it'd be fun to see how I can make certain solutions more idiomatic.

* Clean up the READMEs. Most of them have the problem statement, but many are
  missing inputs, and all are missing Part 2.

* **Ambitiously**, follow-up with _Advent of Blog! The Musical!_, wherein I
  write a post about the language I used, some Pablo opinions, things I learned,
  the choices I made, etc.

### Did you learn anything new?

Tons! And I'll hopefully blog about those in the future. Here are a few:

**You can write Scheme in any language!** I learned that the most powerful
influence on my general programming style were those library nights with books
like [_The Little Schemer_][6], [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs_][7], and [_Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation._][8]

Most of my code:

* Prefers immutability
* Relies on returning values rather than producing effects
* Frequently relies on recursion

and jumping between SML, OCaml, Haskell, Racket, Clojure, and even Erlang hardly
felt like I was using different languages at all.

**Logic programming is a lot more fun than I remember it.** I've played with
Prolog before, but had an absolute blast using it here. Ditto Mercury.

**Wow it's nice working with popular languages.** When you have a bug in your
Mercury or Factor code, you're a bit SOL. It was refreshing getting to, like,
_debug_ again, since you couldn't rely on StackOverflow.

### Miscellanea

**Languages I used for the very first time:** Factor, Pyret, OCaml, Elixir,
Mercury, Lua.

**Languages I've used before _technically_ but only on toy projects, like
this:** SML, Ruby, Prolog, Common Lisp, Rust, Scala, Clojure.

**How did this stack up to other programmer puzzle challenges?** For reference,
I did about 70 problems on [Project Euler][3] back in undergrad. These are a
fair bit easier: past the first 15-20 problems, PE tended to rely on you having
some kind of mathematical or problem-domain insight to massively reduce the
search space. These are far simpler: you can usually just throw the most
straightforward algorithm at a problem, and that is usually brute-force.

My other big experience was the old [Facebook programming puzzles][4] they'd use
for hiring (also described [here][5]), which tended to be more algorithmic
(graph construction/traversal, clever trees, and dynamic programming were
popular in those). Few of these required anything quite like that.

### With that

More to come, I hope! ðŸ˜›
