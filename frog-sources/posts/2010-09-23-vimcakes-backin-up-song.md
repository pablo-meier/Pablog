I found [an awesome little post on Vim][1], which itself links to other excellent
Vim posts.  [BFS][2] these links, kids, and [learn you a console
editor][3] if you haven't already!

Also, I meant to squeeze this video in here somewhere, by the guys who did the
Bed Intruder song:

Source material [here][4]. But do you see this? We have a hilarious remix
coming from [an attempted rape][5], this one from an attempted robbery ending
in gunshots, and the last post was about [the internet taking down an 11 year-
old][6].

Remixes man, [how do they work][7]?
