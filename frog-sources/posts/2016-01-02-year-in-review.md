Let's _blog_ blog this one, and talk about what my life is like for a bit. Like
it's LiveJournal again! [Those were the days.][37] Here's my 2015 in review and 
hopes for 2016; a brief, incomplete, mostly incorrect list.

### Goodbye Sup, hello Reonomy

<div style="width: 700px; margin: 20px auto">
<img src="/img/2016/01/sup.png" alt="Sup logo" style="display: inline; margin-right: 20px" />
<img src="/img/2016/01/reonomy-logo-old.png" alt="Old Reonomy logo" style="display: inline" />

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Sup logo, old Reonomy logo, new Reonomy logo.</p>
</div>

My previous gig (the one that took me to New York) decided it no longer wanted
to be a software shop, but instead make yogurt machines with the rest of their
seed investment. I and the other software engineers were let go (sans one,
working mostly in a hardware capacity for reduced salary, as I understand it).

I wrote about the engineering behind Sup's Android apps [here][5], [here][6],
and [here][7].  You can read a bit about Sup [here][4], and hear me narrate the
promo video _en español_ [here][3]. FWIW, all this was mostly 2014.

I have no hard feelings: I met great people who treated me fabulously, who
trusted and empowered me to work on their baby. Naturally I have OPINIONS about
the product and company, many of them critical, but Sup was a gig that really
turned things around for me professionally, and I'm extremely proud of what we
built. Ask me (in person or email) about this if you'd like more detail 😄

If you told me my next gig would be in <span style="font-family: monospace">
<a href="https://reonomy.com">COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ANALYTICS</a></span> I
wouldn't have believed you, and almost didn't take either the interview or the
role when offered. Most of this was my sheer ignorance of what an opportunity
this was, another part was a surreal interview process with a company that
barely resembles the one I'm currently working at.

<div>
<img src="/img/2016/01/reo-headshot.jpg" alt="Reonomy headshot" style="display: inline; margin-right: 20px" />
<img src="/img/2016/01/reo-headshot-outtake.jpg" alt="Reonomy headshot outtake" style="display: inline" />
<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Left is company headshot, right is an outtake I happen to like.</p>
</div>

I'm exceptionally glad things worked out how they did: I can say with confidence
that Reonomy is the most fulfilling job I've taken since graduating. I work with
some amazing people, have been stretched as an engineer in a number of different
directions, work for a business that sells things to people for money by
reducing inefficiencies in an underserved market, and am trusted with critical
responsibilities.

I have criticisms! _Many_ of them! But the presence of criticisms doesn't make
anything in the preceding paragraph untrue, nor have I worked literally anywhere
else where I didn't have substantial disagreements. As in any non-trivial
software: there's _always_ bugs 😉

**In 2016:** I hope to continue to do well there! Barring some terrible
unforseen cultural issue, personal failing, or **obscene** offer, I don't
anticipate leaving.

If I left, it would be to chase the siren song of starting my own company, since,
[as jwz points out][8], I'm spending my one and only youth producing outsized
wealth for people whose main job is telling me and other people to do things and
collect great rewards, and that's only so cool. I've been pretty (perilously? 
carelessly?) [open about the appeal of this][11] ([hi CEO!][10]) but if I were a
betting man, I'd bet that I continue Working For Other People. My professional
life is usually the most stable slice of my Life Pie, and adding risk to my
financials or [poking my mental health hornet nest][12] would require me to be
on exceptionally good footing.

### I wrote Ghostlight / Attended 60-80 shows

<div style="width: 700px; margin: 20px auto">
<a href="/img/2016/01/shows1_large.jpg"><img src="/img/2016/01/shows1.jpg" alt="Pile o shows"/></a>
<a href="/img/2016/01/shows2_large.jpg"><img src="/img/2016/01/shows2.jpg" alt="Another pile o shows"/></a>
<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Missing is
about 10 <a href="http://www.theflea.org/show_detail.php?show_id=105">serials @ the flea</a>
performances, but they don't let you take that program home. Click for a larger
version. About 2/3 of these are in Ghostlight. Each was a night or afternoon out.</p>
</div>

I've been kicking around the idea behind Ghostlight since I was college, when I
was just making the transition from Theater Kid With Aspirations to Software
Engineer (back then I'd only taken a few classes, hadn't formally listed my
concentration).

---

Sidebar! At one of my acting programs, I'd heard a method from an industry vet
that he said was Guaranteed™ to get you work as an actor: Build a Rolodex (I
told you he was a vet!) of all your contacts from previous work, friends of
friends, and/or from the pages of the industry rags. Then, literally every week:

* **Monday:** Drop off a headshot at the office of 5 of those people in your
  Networking Rolodex, randomly.
* **Tuesday:** Send postcards of your headshots to a different 5 random people
  from this Rolodex.
* **Wednesday:** Call a different 5 of these people. Ask what's up, is there any
  work, what you've worked on recently, what you're interested in, what they've
  been up to…
* **Thursday:** _Visit_ a different 5 of these people, and have a similar
  conversation to the above.
* **Friday:** Take a day to yourself, kid, you've earned it.<br /><br />Just
  kidding! Practice monologues, take classes, add to your Rolodex, and/or
  annotate the cards with details of your conversations, etc.

Over time, this is Guaranteed™ to get you work!

<div style="width: 325px; margin: 20px auto">
<img src="/img/2016/01/ghostlight_logo.png" alt="Ghostlight logo"/>
<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Shitty
Ghostlight logo made with a free tool.</p>
</div>

With that in mind, after a few CS classes, I figured _there has to be a better
way!_ Namely, when thinking of networking in the theater world, I wanted a way
to take the data I had in show programs (every designer, actor, donor, etc.) and
look up what people around me have done so I could use it in conversation
without having to just memorize _every_ show ("oh, I saw you worked with X, who
did the lights for Y show, which I saw and appreciated that they…").

That fed into "what if I could link the information in all the programs
together and make it searchable" which then led to Ghostlight.

You can read a _ton_ more about the ideas behind it on the [About page][13] and
[FAQ][14]: for the purposes of this blog post, you really just need to know that
[I opened sourced it][15] after [some low moments and feelings of defeat][16].
The source is [here][17].

**In 2016**, I may, just may, continue to work on it. Knowing that others can
_see_ it and look at its awful code and deployed instance has me feeling more
motivated since, oh, May. I don't know if it's enough to _break the spell_, but
it feels nice again, and I'm reminded that I really did sink a lot of effort
into this, and that I do believe such an app would be pretty valuable.

Fun facts about Ghostlight!

* The first commit was [on my third day of work at Reonomy][18]. I absolutely
  never touched Ghostlight during work hours, but was amused at what the work
  for both had in common, and enthusiasm for one frequently fed the other.

* I now have a publicly-viewable code commit titled ["FUCK OFF DOUGLAS CROCKFORD"][19].
  And now, it's in my blog! Context: Sometimes blocking synchronous code, even
  in JavaScript, is a perfectly sensible option (in my case, it's a simple
  script that read a small number of tiny files), so if he's gonna drop silly
  judgement in ESLint making a user call themselves stupid to not warn on it,
  I'll judge the hell out of his choice by telling him to fuck off.<br /><br />
  <small style="font-size:x-small">I also think JavaScript: The Good Parts is extremely overrated.</small>

* The last code commit at the time of this writing is [me literally using "good"
  and "bad" incorrectly][20], so maybe Crockford making me call myself stupid is
  totally legit.

### I got back in the Theater game and """directed""" a show!

<div style="width: 615px; margin: 20px auto">
<img src="/img/2016/01/fish_set.jpg" alt="Fish set"/>
<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Set for
<em>Fish Out Of Water</em>.</p>
</div>

This summer I """directed""" [Fish Out Of Water][21], a one-woman show written
by and starring [Charly Evon Simpson][22] ([👻 link][23]).

I put "directed" in triple air quotes because compared to most directing gigs,
my role was pretty minimal. Charly wrote it, performed it, and the show is about
_her_, so I often describe it as her bench pressing while I was spotting.

I don't want to undersell myself: we discussed the text very heavily and
unearthed a ton of connections and narratives that would strongly inform the
performance. We had 8-10 rehearsals, I kept her accountable for lines and during
rehearsals. I also provided its sound and light cues (one of each!). 

In the vein of more traditional directing gigs, I _did_ make a number of
suggestions for staging and design choices, but we decided that most of them
were unnecessary or counterproductive: the strength of the piece is that this is
a look at **her** and she is great, so embellishing that with any Cheap Theater
Craft is almost to pollute it. This wasn't a Benihana spectacle, it was more of
a $60 piece of Fine Fucking Sushi that blissfully sits in your mouth reminding
you that _yes you are alive and that enough feels like something._

And I did it all from the _totally uncompromised_ position of being a
not-always-sympathetic subject _in_ the piece itself, while also being in a
relationship with her that was beginning to feel its seams stretching.

**In 2016**, I highly doubt I'll do anything like this again. This was perfect
because I loved and was heavily committed to both the work and the person behind
it, was uniquely situated (given the subject matter and production realities) to
be the director it needed.

I'm not opposed to the idea of getting back into making more theater, I just
don't think, given everything else I've got going on and my goals for this year,
that I'll be in a position to do this again.

### I broke up

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large">💔</p>

Get your popcorn, kids. Or not, because I uh, [haven't written anything yet][34]
and maybe it won't be too interesting. But this is arguably _the biggest thing_
that happened to me in 2015, it was definitely the hardest, and it feels remiss
not to mention it.

I don't often write about my breakups since it might make recovery situations
worse, because vulnerability is hard, and because it's damn difficult to
condense a topic so rich with emotions, narratives, history, and high stakes
into any prose that would suffice. So normally I just [come up with a convenient
rationalization like this one][24] and opt not to write it, sparing me any real
gut-spilling or public reflection.  

But this story is mine too, and I'm trying to be more open, all things
considered. I'll say a few very high-level True Things that applied to us:

* Charly and I were in the relationship hoping it would end with marriage and
  kids. We played the Marriage Game for keeps: no "let's just try it and if it
  doesn't work out we'll just get a divorce"; a real, 60-80 year, for-life
  commitment to the relationship and each other.

* A marriage and future like that were Strong Requirements for Charly: my
  understanding is that she's wanted a nuclear family in a committed,
  monogamous, happy marriage more than any specific career goal or personal goal
  _since even the first time we dated_ in our early 20's. 

Given all that, the responsible thing to do, if past a certain degree of
certainty you're feeling like you _are incapable_ of performing a lifetime of
the above narrative happily or sufficiently, **is to end the relationship.**

(Now that I've [written some more but still haven't finished][35], I'll point
out what I _won't_ write about, which I imagine is the popcorn-worthy bits: what
led me to realizing the above, and what is "a certain degree of certainty." Ask
me, I'll talk about it but I don't want to write it here).

The aftermath was pretty devastating for both sides and recovery is still
in-process. I [wrote in the Ghostlight blog][16], when discussing why I put
down the project:

> In two weeks of living out of my gym bag I got a place, moved into it, and got
> new furniture. Three weeks after that I got a pup. [...] Self harm has been 
> "on the table" regularly. I've had weeks where I've probably cumulatively
> slept 28 hours. I've been going to a lot more dance classes, though mostly in
> the spirit of [this][26]. I've been an absent friend and family member.

Again, I'm writing about this in this post because coming to this understanding
and acting on it was _fucking hard_, and I feel grateful that I found the
strength to do it because it was a necessary development. So it gets on
the list of victories and celebrations for 2015, even though there was no
fist-pumping or joy, just a shitton of crying and despair but the knowledge that
I've raised the ceiling for both of our futures.

### I started getting therapy again

It's not cheap, and this doctor is out of network (he came recommended; we're
doing very well so I'd rather not change). For both of those reasons, Aetna will
likely make filing claims a colossal pain in the ass. **In 2016** I hope I can
keep doing this but if Aetna wins the red tape battle I might have to change
some shit significantly.

Healthcare. America.

But! Getting therapy in the first place: A victory that belongs to 2015!

### I started dancing again 💃🏽

Mentioned above! Like [that time I brunched][36], I've become the type of person
I love to hate on because I can say the following:

> I can tell you the pros and cons of the various Zumba instructors for Equinox
> gyms in Manhattan!

<p style="font-size: x-small">(no really, I can, hit me up if you want a rec or something)</p>

Joking aside, this has literally been a lifesaver. I've lost ~30ish pounds since
I started (Jesus, from _where?!_ I was already thin…); more than that, I just
feel 100x better. It's not specific to Zumba: the [Pon De FLO][27] classes, and
the class I took that was subbed by the [Zoanee][28] founder, have all been
phenomenal, and I expect would work just as well.

In this specific way, I'm the most happy and fulfilled I've felt in years. The
last time I approached this was when I was a regular at the [Enshin Karate San
Francisco branch][29], under Sensei Tomiyama, around 2012 (if you live in the
Bay Area I can't recommend his classes highly enough). I'm delighted to know I
could feel this way again, and look forward to much more **in 2016.**

### I got a dog

We'll end with dog pics! This really deserves its own post.

I've never been the sole caretaker of a dog, and absolutely loved living with
[George][30]. So through a most lovely co-worker, I adopted **Sapo** 🐸 through
[Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue][32]:

<div style="width: 615px; margin: 20px auto">
<img src="/img/2016/01/bigsapo.jpg" alt="photo of Sapo"/>
</div>

I tag photos with him on Instagram with [#sapogoeswoof][33]. It's been extremely
challenging and extremely rewarding. I love this little guy.

**In 2016** he and I will celebrate a year together in October, grow a little
older together, and nap/cuddle a fuckton.
