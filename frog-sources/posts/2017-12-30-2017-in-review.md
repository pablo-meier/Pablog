    Title: 2017 in Review

I've done this twice recently ([2015][1], [2016][2]), let's do it for 2017!

### I changed gigs **again**

I left ClassPass and joined Lyft in NYC.

Part of me hopes this doesn't keep happening, but I don't regret that it does:
on the spectrum of "believes he's entitled to too much" vs. "doesn't ask for
enough," I'm been pegged by most to be the latter. I require more from my
employers and there's no reason to settle.

Luckily, a month in, Lyft is looking very promising. I'm pretty jaded about what
companies say about themselves, because one can usually just lightly squint at
their actions to see massive contradictions. I'm happy to report that Lyft is
probably the most persuasive employer I've had regarding living up to the ideals
they state and being smart and honest about their business and how it works.
My co-workers and leaders of the company don't shirk away from hard
conversations, and look for many of the things I value most highly when deciding
what and how to build.

ClassPass didn't cut it for reasons I'm happy to go into with anyone who
wants to chat with me. I was and remain pretty sad about leaving because
I worked with some _amazing_ people there on a product I love. I'm
exercising my options, I hope they do well.

**In 2018:** Fuck man, I don't know. I'm still working out what I want out of
working life. I don't feel like I'm well-optimized towards any end goal that
matters to me: most of what I do is make very rich people even richer. And, well,
the ultra-rich suck. They call themselves powerless even though they have these
massive platforms and virtually all the money. I've watched my generation [be
thoroughly fucked from stable living][4] and get blamed for it. I've watched
[most wealth go to the top 1%][3]. I've watched rich White men [mock][18] and
[belittle][19] these concerns while being [cartoonishly doughy sacks of
uselessness.][20] I watch scores of people defend it in ignorance or disbelief
and call it "meritocracy" and deserved.

I'll continue being a Good Employee while I better figure out what I want out
of working and livelihood. Options include: double down on The Game the way I've
been playing it (I wish this wasn't the most likely choice), start my own
company and Be The Change (inching closer, but maybe asymptotic), or start a
labor movement to seize the means of production (because the dickbags need us
nerds to enact any of this via technology; highly unlikely that I do this but I
dream sometimes). Ideally I can support movements to do more systematic change
(I've written before how [I don't think I'm best to lead those movements][21]).

(Memory time! Remember when the company that still lives on "Don't Be Evil"
goodwill and branding [colluded for years to reduce wages][5] with the company
living off goodwill and branding of "Here's To The Crazy Ones"? Remember how
Alan Eustace and friends [groveled and begged Steve Jobs for the privilege of
competing][6] with them in those free markets they fetishize so much? Good
times. Never let any of these people off the hook.)

### I went to Burning Man, played with my brain

I have a few posts in drafts, but this was a pretty major event. I wrote [a
little Twitter thread about it][22], but the short version is: the art is pretty
great, the desert **sucks**, folks can be all things folks can be. Going with
someone you're romantically involved with is a major plus but can also strain
you. It's not easy to get a ticket, it's not easy to go, but if you think
there's a path for you to go I think you should consider it.

Far less daunting, and easier to recommend are Regional Burns: much smaller
Burning Man-like festivals that often take place over a weekend, in less
challenging climates. Karen found a number of amazing events with a similar vibe
that we went to; it was a pretty wildly different cultural experience for me. I
was exposed to some pretty lovely art, and it's great to leave the city and make
an occassion.

Lastly, we made some art together. It barely worked and there's much more to do
with it, but we made a chess set that screams and otherwise reacts when you play
it. This deserves its own post (and we're probably bringing it back) but you can
see some of the code in the embedded Raspberry Pi [here.][14]

I admitted to this in a throwaway line on [my music post][7], but with this
territory: I tried psychadelics (specifically, LSD). It's major enough that I'm
going to say a few words about it.

First, psychadelics have shown [pretty effective in treating depression.][8] It's
a hard thing to research, but anecdotally, this is absolutely true. When
your brain is trapped in its own rock-solid constructions, _there exist
substances that can help you shake up your brain._

Obviously, introducing drugs into your life carries dangerous risks and one
should be careful of romanticizing them as a lifestyle (I want to behead [the
folks who got rich creating the opiod crisis][9], and a few folks close to me
absolutely struggle with addiction). And I don't consider drug use a lifestyle
(I've used maybe 6 or 7 times this year, don't intend or feel more inclined to
do more than that).

But, well, we live in our bodies and our brains, and I think there's merit to
accepting that we're better off with some liberty in what we do with them. Much
of the worst impact of drugs in society comes from the drug trade and
externalities resulting from our criminalization of it. Note [Portugal's
phenomenal success with decriminalization.][10]

LSD has a few qualities I really like:

- Unlike nicotine, caffeine, or opiods, it's not physically addicting. Your body
  will never "crave" it any more than, say, chocolate.

- It has rate limiting built-in: after you dose, it becomes ineffective for a
  few days while your brain recalibrates. So you couldn't really make it a habit
  even if you tried.

- It feels wonderful! I haven't had anything like the traumatic Bad Trip, but
  veered close a few times. Usually, you just feel amazing.

Here are some other articles that I think are worth reading on these topics:

- ["Rave Grandpa"][12] gives good advice.
- More on [therapeutic uses of drugs][16], including MDMA (also tried it, also
  worthwhile, but I'm less bullish on it because [there might be long-term health
  effects.][17] That said, they've never been observed in folks who've used them
  fewer than 50 times, and it's almost impossible to study on its own because
  its users tend to mix it with other drugs.
- Someone I follow on Twitter who has drugs as a larger part of their lifestyle
  [offers some novel perspective][11] in writing an article for parents.

In any case, this was a big find for me this year, like finding fitness was last
year.

**In 2018:** I'm probably going back to Burning Man with Karen: our camp is full
of wonderful people. At the very least we can do a regional. There are other
blog posts in the works but I hope we can build some art to bring and share;
either building off of existing projects or new ones.

### Relationship Milestones

Karen and I moved in together. We consider ourselves extremely lucky that the
other has a dog who brings just as much joy and frustration as our own. We spent
Thanksgiving with my family and Christmas with hers. My life, on the whole,
contains no shortage of relationship overthinking and angst but I'm happy with
how the two of us are going.

**In 2018:** Knock on wood, we continue to do well, keep the magic going, and
summarily identify and execute threats to said magic with gusto and style.

My dog continues to live, seemingly happily, with me for the second year!

I went to Disneyland and [Trejo's Tacos.][13]

Coding projects slowed down, but I ended the year making a bunch of little
changes and reclaiming my blog. It's part of a series of paper cuts on how I
want my relationship with Online to be. I'm also committed to learning about
Machine Learning in the next year.
