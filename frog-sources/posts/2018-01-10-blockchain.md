<small><em>üéµ The song for this post is [Finesse (Remix)][1], by Bruno Mars
feat. Cardi B üéµ</em></small>

It's hard to write novel things, so rather than rehash the points, I'll just
point to some of my favorite pieces on blockchains, cryptocurrency, and
decentralization:

**[Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain][2],** by [Kai
Stinchcombe][5].  I love that his subheading is "whatever the opposite of a
futurist is." It makes a pretty compelling case that many of the "revolutionary"
applications of blockchains have been about as effective at replacing their
incumbents as Wile E. Coyote is at catching birds. Which! Doesn't mean they
**can't** succeed! Just that they haven't, very comically.

**[The Problem with Calling Bitcoin a "Ponzi Scheme"][3]** by [Preston
Byrne][4], which goes pretty into detail about how cryptocurrencies manage
to capture the working parts of both Pyramid and Ponzi schemes while reducing
their weaknesses to getting caught and ferreted out.

[Summer Hale][20] has **[an essay that touches on Federated vs. Distributed vs.
Centralized][10]** very intelligently from the perspective of risk and
empowerment, using Mastodon as an example.

Some thoughts and reflections follow, but üëÜüèº is the better reading to do üòÑ

### Unmoderated systems in practice

Exchanges that are distributed, anonymous, and unmoderated by design are a very
alluring idea. Consider the romantic image of revolutionaries against a despot
communicating through a secure channel that the state can't intercept, or some
modern Galileo saying _important, unpopular truths_ who can't be silenced by
the orthodoxy because they can't be identified.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

I think these channels are important, and deserve being built and defended.
However, I also think most of their proponents are remiss for not acknowledging
other realities about them:

#### They can reinforce existing power structures as much as they thwart them

New systems and technologies require _access_, and _that_ is usually gated. For
example, it would've been hard to participate in the 90's dot-com boom without
computer access.

Similarly, who were the first to get cell phones, and the increased productivity
as a result? The Internet and Google Search? YouTube may have "freed" many
content creators from the inefficiencies of TV, but you needed a camera and
decent upload speed to be one of the early YouTubers.

Unless you specifically design your Enabler Of Freedom around the folks who need
it most, the ones who will usually benefit the most strongly will be the ones
who need it least.

#### Criminals

Friends who go to the "dark web" tell me it's about 20% what most people expect
it to be (radical political discussion by anonymous avatars) and 80%
unadulterated vice: child pornography, drugs, slave trade, and hackers selling
stolen passwords and credit card numbers.

Yes, [HACK THE PLANET][11] and all that, but when you allow nobody to police it,
well, you allow nobody to police it.

#### Actual safety vs. state-level actors is Hard As Hell

Except when they _really_ want to police it.

One of my favorite arguments gun fetishists make is that we need unfettered and
untethered 2nd Amendment interpretations so that we can be sufficiently armed
to fight the government, in case they become tyrannical or murderous to their
populace. Uh, yeah, the government have _tanks_ and _fighter jets._ We [spend
more on our military than the next 7 nations combined][12]. You and your
tough-guy friends with AR-15s aren't going to topple trained professionals with
that level of equipment.

Similarly, while the mathematical primitives underlying all this tech is sound,
as the old saying goes: "In theory, theory and practice are the same. In
practice, they're very different." Using all this tech _in practice_ proves to
be crippling, and I consider it unlikely you'll topple that orthodoxy.

Look at how [the creator of PGP refuses to use it][13]. Look at [the
complications in executing an air gap][14]. Consider ways that [Tor's benefits
can be made null.][15] World-ending vulnerabilities like [Heartbleed][16] and
[Spectre][17]? How much do you wanna bet that they were discovered by State
Intelligence well before researchers, given that the government [uses undisclosed
vulnerabilities regularly][18]?

Let's not forget the xkcd on this:

So, yes, build that decentralized network so The Thoughts Of People Can Be Free,
but unless you address that pesky "society" and solve 3-4 other hard problems:

- If the powers that be ever _do_ encouter a challenge, there's a good chance
  your New Effort won't be a magical tech that prevents them from getting found
  out and murdered anyways.

- Criminals who don't threaten the existence of the state enough to get the big
  guns pointed at them (or are so numerous they'd overwhelm the big guns) will
  be empowered more than they already are.

- Your network will probably just be a bunch of privileged early adopters who
  may only support noble causes in spirit and intention but end up hurting it
  (think little Julian Assanges, only not famous).

I repeat: **build and defend these tools and networks.** I'm in _no_ way saying
not to, nor do I mean to diminish the people and work that brought us here. But
please be mindful of the above.

Paraphrasing something I remember [tef][19] saying: if you ask programmers to
solve a problem that's 90% social and 10% technical, they'll spend most of their
time on the technical bit. The technical bit is (comparably) _easy_.
Blockchains, 10 years in, still feel like a very cool solution in search of a
problem.

### Additional Fun Reading

Sometimes programmers hit me hard with great senses of humor. So there's a
great little language called [Scheme][8], of which some nerds made into
another great language called [Racket][7]. Michael Burge used Racket to make
a new Scheme dialect for writing blockchain applications,
[called **Pyramid Scheme.**][6]

One of the tells that _Ender's Game_ is good _fantasy_ but shouldn't be read as
taking place on any planet approaching our own is the bit where 11 year olds are
given access to anonymous message boards and able to influence global politics
through "the marketplace of ideas" because They're Geniuses Like You, Dear
Reader.
