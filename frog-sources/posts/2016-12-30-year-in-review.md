**I wrote most of this on the last day of 2016. Then I put it down and forgot
about it. I'm publishing it late, but will throw color commentary _in italics_.
Here we go.**

My last [year in review][1] was received pretty positively, so let's try this
again. Here's my 2016 in review (Christ, what happened to this year?) with hopes
for 2017; a brief, mostly incorrect list:

### I switched gigs

<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic">Thanks Reonomy! And thanks, ClassPass!</p>
</div>

In October, I started at [ClassPass][2]. The transition hasn't been the
smoothest; at previous startups, I was a much earlier employee, so had a lot
more space to shape the culture, with less existing culture to accommodate.
Furthermore, previous companies didn't have many customers, the activity of
those customers wasn't very high, and the activity in any given hour had little
impact on revenue.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">\[1\]</a></sup> Jumping into a
situation where your machines are actually taxed and the cost of outage directly
leads to lots of lost revenue makes the ramping up take longer than I like to be
patient for.

Still, this was **absolutely** the right choice for me. My current manager
is fantastic with people and bleeds exceptionally for us. He read [my opinions
on management][3] and looked at me as a partner, not a liability. Everyone I've
worked with here has been a fantastic technologist _and_ a pleasure to know, and
this is the most confident I've felt in a product and company in ages.

_(April 2017 Update 1: he's no longer at the company! RIP buddy. But the rest is
absolutely true üòõ)_

Finally, I started training to be an instructor for [Pon de FLO][18], my
favorite workout. They recently changed from a Zumba-style business model of
licensing instructors and letting it spread worldwide + monthly instructor dues
to a boutique studio model (a la SoulCycle or Barry's Boot Camp), and if
everything goes according to plan I'll be an instructor in their first studio.

_(April 2017 Update 2: This is also no longer happening. Not for lack of effort
or enthusiasm; the studio owner and I just came to believe it's best to not
pursue this anymore. Hit me up for details if you're curious.)_

<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic">The jumps in
this workout can be killer.</p>
</div>

**Going into 2017**, I hope to keep on top of it. There's an employee here at
ClassPass who also teaches a few Zumba classes a week, and that strikes me as
living the dream. I'd like to continue to succeed here at ClassPass while
teaching throughout the week.

_lol_

### Much higher success rate on fighting off the depression

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's an odd thing, but while 2016 was such a terrible year for humanity (the
planet is boiling and we elected a pathetic orange fascist), I had one of the
best years I can remember. I had my healthiest relationships, experienced career
definition and growth, but as it pertains to this point, **didn't want to die
for most of it.**

([I wrote about my depression three years ago][4], after already having spent a
good number of years fighting it.)

I'm not claiming to be in the clear; I suspect this will be a fight for a good,
long time. The initiatives I started last year (and alluded to in last year's
post) are my best guesses for this change:

_this, thankfully, remains true._

#### I got into much better shape.

I made some changes to my diet, and treated exercise as a necessary medication,
rather than "a thing I should do, aspirationally." Much of it is spiritually
modelled after [this essay][8], one of my favorite things written in the last
few years. In a not-so-different universe, both this post and last year's
roundup read a lot like it. Key was finding exercises that pulled me back for
more, which was mostly dance. Fact is, we live in our bodies, so as smart as you
think you are, you can hack the feeling of happiness by doing right by your
physical vessel.

#### Therapy.

Anyone who's friends with me knows that I never frame this as "it's the
best!!!!" It's my second-largest expense after rent, and the person I see, while
great, takes a "sit back an listen" approach, which makes it feel like I'm doing
all the heavy lifting (which, I guess I am).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[In the
gym] hey guys it&#39;d be a lot easier to lift these weights if we worked
together</p>&mdash; Michael Raphone, Sr. (@michael\_raphone) <a
href="https://twitter.com/michael_raphone/status/399550282977538049">November

That said, he is a good listener, and the space it gives me to work things out
has been helpful. I've taken a lot of the work from there and made different,
better choices because of it. I'm convinced it's helped me tremendously.

As a conversation piece, I often ask people melodramatically "what is 2017 The
Year Of? For you, &lt;NAME&gt;, 2017 is the Year of the‚Ä¶?'", then I let them
fill in the blank. It's usually fun, people enjoy the excuse to get reflective
and goal-settey in a low-pressure environment. In my case, I'll steal the
language of my current partner when I asked her this, and say next year I hope
to Make It Stick.

One moment I had in therapy that shook my usually laid-back therapist was a
sentence like "man, I really like all this dancing. I hope I keep it up," which
got him to sit upright with _"Well why the hell wouldn't you?!"_ I couldn't
produce a reason, I just had a feeling: after all, I've stopped before. Many
times in my history I've let myself rot. I could very well let this slip. But
his outburst reminded me there's no extenuating circumstance that's _forcing_
such an error.

I go back to his "why the hell wouldn't you?!" when I feel myself slipping. I
also told him about this sketch, which I feel 11 different ways about (mostly
positive):

<iframe width="560" height="315"

allowfullscreen></iframe>

This plays nicely into the last one:

#### Giving fewer fucks.

Harder to quantify, but this year I plainly gave fewer fucks about things I
believed prevented me from feeling like I wanted to feel. I forget who said
"people more often get what they ask for rather than what they deserve," but it
hit me hard, and I subsequently asked for more, and more often.  I spoke up to
authority more often when I felt they hadn't earned it. I said yes to more
adventures (some of which were a bit dangerous, in retrospect). In short, I
lived more genuinely.

So we'll see. Here's to being alive.

**Going into 2017** I damn well better keep moving, I intend to keep up therapy,
and I'll continue to let Pablo out with more frequency than I have at previous
points in my life.

### I wrote code in new languages

The side projects were a bit more of a dry well this year; my [Ghostlight][9] of
this year has slowed down a bit (and under wraps, but the not-so-hidden truth is
that it's me playing with [ideas I've blogged about before][10]).

Ghostlight stuttered for a few reasons, but one of them was I tried to be a bit
too ambitious with the technology. I [spent Innovation Tokens too early][11]. I
also never considered whether the product was any good beyond "I think I'd want
it." Apologies for linking pg, but I found [Artix][19] to be a great parallel
for it.  If I ever try to productize the current project, it'll be largely
because I didn't try to write it in Prolog.

That said, I was surprised that a polyglot project came up, and that I had so
much damn fun with it: [23-odd languages for Advent of Code][12]. The ones I'm
most proud of were [my first Factor code][13], [my first Mercury code][14], and
getting to hack in [C][15] and [C++][16] again.

### I had healthier relationships

I think part of why my post resonated last year was because I stumbled
into vulnerability writing about the end of a very meaningful relationship.
Charly and I had a story involving real stakes (me moving my life out from
Texas to Philly) with many hopeful elements (re-igniting our college
relationship, to much support of our mutual friends + faculty). For many in our
lives we were "the solid relationship," and I firmly believe we were damn
adorable.

So let's try vulnerability again. Here's some backstory: my dating life, coming
into 2016, looked like

* 2003-2004, then I ended it.
* 2006-2009, then I ended it.\*
* Two smaller relationships in 2009 (4 months each) which I ended.
* 2009-2012, which I ended.\*
* 2012-2013, which I ended.\*
* 2013-2015, which I ended.\*

Asterisks indicate that there were "Future" or "This Is The Big One" talks in
the relationships. You could arguably even asterisk the first one through the
magical optimism you can generate at 18 years old.

So for the past few years I've been pretty self-conscious coming into dating,
because it felt more and more inevitable that entering a relationship with me
has one outcome, and that's me hurting the person I still genuinely
loved<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">\[2\]</a></sup>. They were all ready to take
steps ahead, while I wasn't. My brother Robert was with the same person for
7-odd years before they got engaged (still happily married, they made an
adorable baby); here I was dropping the ball after 2 years and change. After a
while, it felt irresponsible to go forward.

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size: small;">(did I mention I'm in therapy? because this never, ever comes up)</p>

So I already alluded to it, but I'm very proud that this year, I had (what I
consider) much healthier relationships. I avoided codependency, maintained
active communication, and was more clear and honest with myself (and my
partners) about what I wanted, and what I could provide.

This isn't to say there wasn't (immense) heartache, nights of fits and starts,
crying, or desperate loneliness. That‚Ä¶ was all there. But it feels like I'm
making new, better mistakes.

### Another year with the pup

So now that I've kept him alive for over a year, I can tell the more nuanced
story of Sapo, my little bastard kangaroo. Charly and I lived with [George, who
is a _phenomenal_ dog.][20] When first moving to Philly to reunite with Charly,
I was sure I'd be okay with him, but I didn't anticipate the attachment I
formed. He was [so nice to come home to][21], and after the breakup, I knew I
wanted a pup. The marvelous [Rolando][22] got [his amazing dog][23] from [Badass
Brooklyn Animal Rescue][24], and helped work me through the process.

Not long later, I welcomed Sapo home. My friends‚Ä¶ that first few months, **I was
not prepared.** Sapo:

* Chews. Everything. He's eaten two pairs of Sennheisers, about a dozen pens, a
  few pairs of shoes, three excellent sweaters, an entire bed kit (comforter,
  sheets, pillowcases), about 18 toys, a backpack, a few tubes of topical
  medications, a lot of mail + brochures, my college diploma, and a ton more I
  can't list. He's also knocked over several glasses and mugs.

* Was prone to accidents. I used to joke "I'd say he will leave me a surprise
  but I don't call them 'surprises' anymore because it's semantically incorrect;
  I call them 'expecteds.'"

* Requires a ton of walking. The little broseph has a ton of energy, and usually
  "goes" after 20-25 minutes of walking. He also used to pull **hard** on the
  least, in every direction. He was taking _me_ for walks.<br /><br />FWIW, this
  is also a huge plus. Hitting 10,000 steps a day is a breeze in large part
  because of this üòÑ

* Has zero boundaries. He still climbs me on a regular basis, and jumps on any
  and every human he likes. After a few sniffs, he'll just lick you. The bed is
  his, you just sleep on it.

None of this was particularly hard; I _certainly_ don't blame him. He's a dog!
It was just a bit more of a disruption than I expected. The biggest fear was
what he'd do my dating prospects, especially if I was "dude who sleeps under
ribbons of ripped sheets."

_Just_ as we were finding our rhythm, it all came to a head when he was climbing
up kitchen equipment and turned on the stove, starting a fire in my apartment:

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center">
<img src="/img/2017/01/stove_fire.jpg" alt="Stove fire" style="display: inline;" />
<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic">Not
pictured: the <em>entire</em> apartment covered in soot, ash, and dust.</p>
</div>

On the stove was his dogwalking equipment, so I'm calling this a political
statement. I've (mostly) fixed everything, at considerable expense. And hey, he
was trapped in a burning apartment, so a) he got the worse end of the deal, and
b) he got to roleplay a famous meme!

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center">
<img src="/img/2017/01/this_is_fine_dog.png" alt="This is Fine" style="display: inline;" />
</div>


All that said, **wow did I get lucky with this dog.** On top of being absolutely
adorable, he's incredibly sweet, good to other dogs. This year is highlighted by
many a day where this little kangaroo made me laugh, calmed me down, and kept me
grounded.
