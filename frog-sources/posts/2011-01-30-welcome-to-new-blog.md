    Title: Welcome to the new blog!

Welcome to the new morepablo.com!  After tons of reading, I decided to move
my blog over to [Jekyll][1], for a variety of reasons:

First, I like having all my content, readily available, in plain text on any
of my local machines.  This has tons of upsides, the most prominent being
absolute control of all the elements of my blog.  Notice the text
justification is actually using the [Knuth line-breaking algorithm][2],
[implemented][3] in Javascript!

<!-- more -->

This system also allows me to author pages using Vim, in [Markdown][4];
it allows me to post code snippets without going off-site to Gist; it
allows me to structure my blog as a Git repository, which I find intuitive.

Altogether, this should make for a better experience. Should I choose to
make a ``starcraft.morepablo.com`` or a `scrabblecheat.morepablo.com`, this
would let me do it.

In the meantime, a few caveats: YouTube links of times prior didn't
survive the transition. I'm working on getting them back, but it'll be some
time. The blog is also a bit ugly at the moment, though I'll be making
little updates here and there to improve it.  Note that if you'd like to
visit the previous iteration of this blog, it's still up at
[http://littleschemer.blogspot.com][5], and I have no intention of taking it
down.  New posts will show up here, naturally.

In the meantime, let me know what you think ^\_^
