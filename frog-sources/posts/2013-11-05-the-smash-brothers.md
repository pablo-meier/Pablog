While [I play a ton of StarCraft][1], one of the games closest to my heart is
_Super Smash Bros. Melee._ I probably played that game more than any other in
high school, and only as I was having to focus on my senior year and a major
production did I discover that there was a high-level scene, where people (about
my age, often younger) from disparate cities would drive up and down coasts to
play and learn from each other.

A member of the community made a _fantastic_ documentary on the game and its
most influential players. If you ever played the game, at any level, there's a
good chance you'll love checking it out. Even if you've never played it, it's
a very entertaining story.
