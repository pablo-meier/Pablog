Let's talk about meetings! Why are there so many of them, especially since
everyone hates them?

### "Not by piling feature upon feature‚Ä¶"

One of my favorite quotes in design comes from the Scheme Steering Committee, a
group in charge of the design of the [Scheme][1] programming language. For
context, Scheme is designed minimally: it gives you the barest computing primitives
and expects its users to fill in the rest. They introduced [a very loved
revision of the language][2] with:

> Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
> feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
> features appear necessary.

When people complain about meetings, they usually ask the wrong question.
**Organizations ask "how can we schedule fewer meetings?" but should instead ask
"what is making this number of meetings feel necessary?"** Well-intentioned
palliatives like "no-meeting Wednesday" aren't addressing the core problems.

I'll discuss those "core problems" [in Part 2][14]; here, I'll talk about how,
just [as when we arrive at technical decisions][11], the main driver behind
what Work At A Company feels like is some very human failure modes by the people
who make up that company.

### Why not address the core problems?

The short reason: they're cultural, changing culture is hard, and the
folks most able to change it (people in leadership) are frequently incentivized to
cultivate a different set of skills. Acknowledging that your culture is broken
requires management to be patient, able to work on itself, self-aware, and have
the trust of their peers, which is hard for _anybody_.

I'll substantiate "are incentivized to cultivate a different set of skills":

**Large companies generally reward people more for their ability to manage up
over their ability to manage down.** It's not the subordinates who choose to
hire the director, VP, or C-level. Reports don't choose to give their bosses a
promotion. The tier above a manager or a leader is more likely to have those
juicy LinkedIn contacts. I know one exec who is talked about as "the guy who
went to Zuckerberg's wedding." He probably even likes that this is what people
lead with.

Further, it's very possible for a manager/leader to look good to their boss even
if their reports are suffering or failing, because _their_ bosses are also
managing up and not paying attention. I've seen departments where emotional
abuse tactics from the director (ALLCAPS text messages in the middle of the
night, name-calling, belittling, lying to laterals) were common _and completely
unknown to their executive,_ because that director smiled well in their 1:1s 
and the exec had "bigger things to deal with." They're now a director at another
company.

Leaders have more weight in changing culture because they have so many
people in the org tree beneath them, hanging on their every word. Paradoxically,
many get higher up the tree by paying more attention _up_ than _down._

**Many companies promote people with Blowhard Syndrome.** Many of us are
familiar with [Imposter Syndrome][6], where many (usually underrepresented)
people feel like they'll be "found out" for not being good enough, that they're
"imposters" in their jobs, even though the reality is they have the necessary
skills. I wish more of us used the phrase of [its dual, Blowhard Syndrome,
coined by Christina Xu][5]:

> While there are a few situations that make me feel insecure, I am, for the
> most part, an excellent judge of what I‚Äôm capable of. Expressing a reasonable
> amount of doubt and concern about a situation that is slightly outside my
> comfort zone is normal, responsible behavior. Understanding my limits and
> being willing to acknowledge them is, in fact, one of my strengths. I don‚Äôt
> think it should be pathologized alongside the very real problem of ‚Äúimpostor
> syndrome‚Äù.

> In fact, it is the opposite behavior‚Äîthe belief that you can do anything,
> including things you are blatantly not qualified for or straight up lying
> about‚Äîshould be pathologized. It has many names (Dunning-Krueger, illusory
> superiority), but I suggest we call it **blowhard syndrome** as a neat parallel.
> Blowhard syndrome is all around us, but I have a special fondness in my heart
> for [the example my friend Nicole has taxidermied on her Twitter profile.][10]

It goes without saying that someone performing Blowhard Syndrome is
probably not the best person to fix culture. These people are everywhere in
management because many power brokers love folks who talk a big game üëÜüèº

**Alternatively, some leaders realize their own powerlessness, so they evade
direct engagement with their reports or their work.** A sizeable number of folks
in leadership positions aren't Patrick Bateman, and run the risk of having _just
the wrong amount_ of awareness. They get rightfully scared that employees will
realize the old socialist dictum "we don't need bosses, bosses need us!" Larry
and Sergey aren't the ones swapping out failing disks in Google's datacenters.
Jess Bezos isn't gonna stock millions of boxes a day.

This is why any emergency that goes sufficiently high up usually ends up with
_Spaceballs_-inspired leadership:

To acknowledge and subsequently to fix culture means a leader has to critically 
engage with it, which they may avoid because it may lead to their reports seeing
how little they actually understand (or sometimes, care about) the work and the
problem domain the company ostensibly tackles. They're more comfortable
demonstrating to their boss that they can read a spreadsheet than have to engage
with the people working on the product.

Also! Reminder that #NotAllBosses. I'm looking at incentives and making note of
what I've seen. I've also worked with some brilliant, inspiring bosses.

### Parasites

Back to meetings (kinda): [Every complex system has parasites.][3] If there's a
niche, a parasite will fill it, and white-collar company culture is no
exception. This is part of what I allude to when I keep mentioning [that every
role has different criteria for _getting_ the role than executing the role,][4]
as well as the above points on who sometimes ends up in leadership roles.

This all ties into meetings because there are people who thrive in dysfunctional
meeting cultures like fungal spores in moisture, and will (often subconsciously)
perpetuate and defend it, since it keeps the spotlight on where they are strong
rather than where they are clueless. Commanding a high salary while always being
in Important Meetings is one of the most accepted and desirable narratives in professional
life, so to many people, this _is_ success. It shouldn't surprise that there's
an unwillingness to question whether all these meeetings are the expensive
illusion of success. **The main thing you can do to remove meetings
from your org is to remove the people who seem to need them like oxygen.**

It seems harsh (and feels harsh typing it), but if you need something out of
your org (meetings and the culture that produces them), you should remove the
source. Building teams and processes that don't require frequent,
company-halting, [creativity-destroying][13] meetings is a valuable professional
skill and you should seek leaders who can do it.

Okay, great, so how do you spot them? Carefully. They usually wear markers of
performing competence, and performing competence to many power brokers is
functionally equivalent to performing confidence (see: blowhard syndrome). This
is often some combination of being articulate, being credentialed, having good
posture/teeth, being conventionally attractive and/or charming, and seeming to
favor organization (everything goes into a doc or spreadsheet; neat taxonomies
for everything) over discipline (actually sitting down and looking over the work
of your reports).

They'll rely on tired, always-true statements like "let's take a step back here,"
or "how will this scale?" See a bunch of others [here][8].

Do their proposed solutions to org troubles involve hiring?

How often do you verify their narrative on their team's performance? How do they
react to that kind of audit? Do they own shortcomings, or blame circumstance or
their team members?

Ask their reports directly: when [PERSON] comes to your desk, do you feel good,
neutral, or bad? Do they make it easier or harder for you to perform your tasks,
and how?

### Just get the right people and do the damn work

Get good people, keep good people. Pay attention to who gets fired and who gets
promoted. Are you accidentally rewarding the above behaviors? Measure how well
leaders and managers are managing down and treat it as one of your company's
most important OKRs.

Really, learn that **good company culture, like having correct business
accounting, is not something you can just count on happening, you must allocate
resources to it and treat it as critical to the survival of your business.** If
you misreport your books, your business dies despite your product or your
customers. Responsible business leaders don't ad-hoc their books, _they hire
accountants_, they spend money and energy, they do audits. You must do the same
with culture.

If you have 5 minutes, watch Jay Smooth talk about it on a more personal scale:
nobody is "finished" being a good person, they must work on it every day.
Companies are the same.

In [Part 2,][14] I'll talk a bit about what cultural problems have "creating
meetings" as a symptom. But really, start with the people.
