After playing [Skies of Arcadia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skies_of_Arcadia)
(probably my favorite JRPG of all time, with the
[only main character I can ever cosplay as][2]), I took a liking to the Age of
Exploration: a time where new lands could be explored with a good ship and a lot
of gumption.

<!-- more -->

I started asking friends: "If you could go back to another time in history, what
would it be?"  The girl I liked said the 20's, she'd like to be a flapper girl,
wear hats, that kind of thing.  My favorite response:

> Yeah... when you're black, going *back* in time isn't something you fantasize
> about often.

While I pass for white, being in technology and listening to music assisted by
technology... I'm going to have to agree.  I love 2011, and I love that I'll
love 2031 even more.
