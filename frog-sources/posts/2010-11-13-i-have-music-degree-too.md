Little known fact, but true.  While I took traditional music theory and piano,
I kind of endured that; the degree had a focus on Electronic Music and digital
media production. It was affiliated with the [Multimedia and Electronic Music
Experiments (MEME)][1] program at Brown.

kind of things is pretty awesome:

refresher:
