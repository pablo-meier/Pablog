On [why Steve Ballmer is cooler than Steve Jobs][1]:

> Can you believe it? Plug “How to be Steve Jobs” or “Steve Jobs lessons” into
> Google and you’ll get page after page of tips. One trite homily after another
> explains how to imitate a few of the great dictator’s tics. Switch “Jobs” for
> “Ballmer” and you get almost nothing.

> I bet you could learn a lot from Steve Ballmer. More than you can learn from
> Jobs. You’re not like Jobs. Jobs was a handsome lustrous-haired genius who
> hooked up with another genius in his early 20s and formed a new, globally
> important (and immediately successful) company. Ballmer was a funny looking bald

I'm sure Ballmer will have a ton to answer for when the guillotines come, and I
recognize he can only be this way because of his privilege, but goddammit if
we're going to be subject to a plutocracy I'm glad at least some of them can be
entertaining.

* "non-genius" [is a bit reductive][2] in light of of Ballmer's pre-Microsoft achievements.
* A [longer profile][3], wherein he appears to be a more typical billionaire.
