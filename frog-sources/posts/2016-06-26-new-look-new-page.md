I've decided to take another shot at this page. While the ole' poop-colored
serif site was nice, now it's time to make things **MODERN** ðŸ‘½

Here are [two][1] [screenshots][2] of the old one for posterity's sake.

I wrote an entire page about what this migration entailed, and will have it
there as a static page. [Check it out][3].

Updates to come, maybe!
