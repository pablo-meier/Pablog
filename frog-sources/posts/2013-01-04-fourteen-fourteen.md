    Title: Good ole 14/14

My buddy [Warren][1] and I had a Twitter conversation about learning Zerg in the
lower levels of Starcraft 2, and asked what a good beginner build would be for a
low-level player trying to get the basics.

Luckily, such a build exists! The "14/14" is a single build you can use in any
matchup that leaves you (relatively) safe from cheese and (relatively) set for
a decent economy. It's a very old build that's been around since the release,
and I got to Diamond using only this for my ZvZ's.

Liquipedia has a [decent entry on it][2], but here's the basics:

* 9 Overlord
* 14 extractor
* 14 spawning pool
* 15 overlord - stop droning.
* @ extractor complete, put 3 drones in.
* @ spawning pool complete:
* * Queen
* * Metabolic Boost
* * 1 pair zerglings, resume droning.
* * Remove 2 of the drones out of gas, back on minerals.
* 20 Hatchery @ natural expansion.

Some further notes on this build, and the silly shit you can expect from
lower-league players (since they loooooooove their gambits and cheeses):

* **ZvZ:** This build is best for ZvZ, since the spawning pool comes _barely_
  in time to stop a 7 or 9 pool. You will have to micro your drones, and
  it's not a guarantee. If hit by a rush like this, drop a spine as soon
  as possible, make lings of your own if you have the larva, and maybe get a
  queen if you can afford it and feel like you might have 25-30 seconds of
  security.

  If your opponent is hatch-first, you will have speed before him/her, so try to
  attack early with lots of speedlings. Put 2 drones back on gas, get a baneling
  nest when you hit 50 gas, make banes as soon as it finishes, and get called a
  noob for "all-inning".

* **ZvT:** While 15 hatching is preferable, you'll often get proxy raxed. This
  is much easier to defend with the 14/14 build, which gives you lings + queen.
  When your 15 overlord pops, place it where the natural expansion goes to spot,
  for bunkers, since they'll occasionally try to build bunkers there (in that
  case, send 2-3 drones and kill the worker). A building hatchery has almost
  zero vision.

  Annoying things you'll see in lower leagues: banshee rushes, stim pushes, and
  mech turtles. For Terran, you'll want to put down an evolution chamber and
  baneling nest soon after your second hatch, and start collecting gas. The
  evolution chamber lets you upgrade your lings and banes, and lets you build
  spore crawlers for banshees. When in doubt, just build a shitton of lings and
  banes.

  For mech turtles (where they sit on two base and don't leave until they have a
  million thors and tanks)... these are the most annoying at the lower levels,
  but where you'll get your best macro game practice. Take the map, tech up to
  Hive, get upgrades. You'll need to abuse mobility and keep them from expanding
  and later engage with a Zerg deathball of Broodlords, Corruptors, and
  Infestors.

* **ZvP:** Protoss are a pain in the ass. Make sure you take a drone and make an
  early ring around your base to look for the cannon rush, around 10 or 12 supply.
  If you see one, _don't panic_, build a spine crawler or two as soon as you
  can, and that prevents them from building any closer to you. Use a queen to
  pick of the probe if you can. If you get trapped in your base, tech to Lair,
  build roaches float an overlord to their base, and drop a Nydus Worm. Most
  cannon rushers who don't know what to do have nothing at home, and poor macro.

  You'll also get DT rushed a lot, especially from players who fail their cannon
  rushes. When in doubt, build an evolution chamber, and make a spore crawler in
  your base. Also good against mass void rays, which is less popular these days
  but still around (infestors do well against them, as do hydras). Float an
  overlord past their base and look for Stargates.

This is a _lot_ of information to take in, and there's a _ton_ more I can say,
but above all: don't panic, try to relax, and understand that the only way to
really learn to play is to play, and stumble a fuckton. Nowadays I can look at a
Protoss composition and see how many roaches I have, I can make a reasonable
guess as to whether or not I can take them. But that certainly wasn't always the
case: I had to lose many, many armies before I could eyeball it decently. I've
also been supply blocked tens of thousands of times.

Focus on one thing (supply blocking, larva injects, larva utilization...) and
focus on improving _that one element_, one game at a time. Regardless of what
the score screen says, if you were mindful of that element, consider it a win
and have a beer.

My favorite motivational quote (God... I can't believe I can say this) came from
a local swim coach in Washington DC named Jim Williams, who said

<blockquote>
"If you want to swim fast, you have to swim fast."
</blockquote>

Which I use for anything I want to get good at. If I want to be someone who
writes good programs, I have to be someone who writes good programs; I'd
better start programming, and stop reading blog posts, or mailing lists, or
watching streams. It's like all the people who want to be great writers, but
haven't, you know... actually _written_ anything yet.

Similarly, if you want to get good at Starcraft, the biggest (and most
difficult!) obstacle is just getting the nerve to play, especially when you
think you're terrible and hopeless (which in my case, is more often than I'd
like).
