# About

I'm living in New York City. For work, I've mostly developed software, having
worked for Adobe on the [Flash Platform][2] from 2010-2012, and for Google
briefly on their [API console][3] from 2012-2013, until I decided to follow
someone, taking me away from the Bay Area. After that I was the second employee
Looksee, which made the [fun, but ill-fated Sup app][4].

Most recently, I joined [Reonomy][5] as a Series B employee in 2015, where I was
an engineer for about a year before getting promoted to a Lead, where I've been
managing more.

Before software, I was into theatre, having worked mostly as an actor
and a sound designer, about 10-15 shows as each. I've also dabbled in modern
dance before pursuing other production opportunities, and directing, which was
a bit more rare. Performance is still always on the mind.

I made the transition from theatre to engineering at Brown University. Before
that, I grew up in Washington, DC. with a very lovely family.

## FAQ!

There is one frequently asked question.

#### Is it 'Pablo' or 'Paul'? Which is your <em>real</em> name?

Yes!

Legally, my name is Paul, and that's what most of my English-speaking people
called me in school and my first two jobs. My siblings, cousins, and exes all
mostly call me "Paul."

But my parents and grandparents have called me exclusively Pablo for [as long as
I've been processing language][1], and it's what I've always felt more
comfortable with. I've been using it more with the last two gigs, and most
recent co-workers find calling me "Paul" as alien as I do when I look into a
mirror.

Ultimately, I answer to both, and feel like I am both. People have actually been
emotionally invested in how I approach this issue. Enough that I felt compelled
to write about it. Weird.
