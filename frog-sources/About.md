# About

I'm a 28 year-old living in New York City. For work, I've mostly
developed software, having worked for Adobe on the [Flash Platform][2] from
2010-2012, and for Google briefly on their [API console][3] from 2012-2013,
until I decided to follow someone, taking me away from the Bay Area. After that
I was the second employee Looksee, which made the [fun, but ill-fated Sup app][4].

Before software, I was into theatre, having worked mostly as an actor
and a sound designer, about 10-15 shows as each. I've also dabbled in modern
dance before pursuing other production opportunities, and directing, which was
a bit more rare. Performance is still always on the mind.

I made the transition from theatre to engineering at Brown University. Before
that, I grew up in Washington, DC. with a very lovely family.

## FAQ!

There is one frequently asked question.

#### Is it 'Pablo' or 'Paul'? Which is your <em>real</em> name?

Yes.

Really, that's just all there is to it. Legally, my name is Paul, and that's
what most of my English-speaking friends call me, but my family has called
me Pablo for [as long as I've been processing language.][1] So I answer to
both, and feel like I am both.

People have actually been emotionally invested in how I approach this issue.
Enough that I felt compelled to write about it. Weird.
