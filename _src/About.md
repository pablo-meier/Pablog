# About

I'm a 27 year-old living in Philadelphia, PA. For work, I've mostly
developed software, having worked for Adobe on the [Flash Platform][2] from
2010-2012, and for Google briefly on their [API console][3] from 2012-2013,
until I decided to follow someone, taking me away from the Bay Area.

Before software, I was into theatre, having worked mostly as an actor
and a sound designer, about 10-15 shows as each. I've also dabbled in modern
dance before pursuing other production opportunities, and directing, which was
a bit more rare. Performance is still always on the mind.

I made the transition from Actorbro to Engineerbro at BROwn University. Before
that, I grew up in Washington, DC. with a very lovely family.

Nowawdays, I'm just Pabro. Bro bro bro. Brah.\*

When I'm not doing software or performance opportunities, I'm usually at a dojo,
reading a book, or playing StarCraft. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to
play games on Battle.net or Steam, I have accounts there too :)

\* = Also, to be COMPLETELY clear here: I'm joking with all the Bro stuff.
I'm not a bro, and don't love the trend/culture associated with the word
'brogrammers' (but to each their own and all that).

## FAQ!

There is one frequently asked question.

#### Is it 'Pablo' or 'Paul'? Which is your <em>real</em> name?

Yes.

Really, that's just all there is to it. Legally, my name is Paul, and that's
what most of my English-speaking friends call me, but my family has called
me Pablo for [as long as I've been processing language.][1] So I answer to
both, and feel like I am both.

People have actually been emotionally invested in how I approach this issue.
Enough that I felt compelled to write about it. Weird.
