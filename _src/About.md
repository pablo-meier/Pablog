# About

I'm a 27 year-old dudebro living in Austin, TX. For work, I've mostly developed
software, having worked for Adobe on the [Flash Platform][2] from 2010-2012, and
for Google briefly on their [API console][3] from 2012-2013, until I decided to
follow someone, taking me away from the Bay Area.

Before software, I was into theatre production, having worked mostly as an actor
and a sound designer, about 10-15 shows as each. I've also dabbled in modern
dance before pursuing other production opportunities, and directing, which was
a bit more rare. Performance is still always on the mind.

I made the transition from Actorbro to Engineerbro at BROwn University. Before
that, I grew up in Washington, DC. with a very lovely family.

Nowawdays, I'm just Pabro. Bro bro bro. Brah.

I'm on a bunch of social networks, if you want to follow, friend, or 'encircle'
me:

* [G+](https://plus.google.com/105384565409386633298)
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SrPablo)
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com/paul-meier)
* [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/sicp) (mostly playing Starcraft 2 or Dota 2)

Contact me if you'd like to play games on Battle.net or Steam, I have accounts
there too :)

## So is it Paul or Pablo?

Yes.

Really, that's just all there is to it. Legally, my name is Paul, and that's
what most of my English-speaking friends call me, but my family has called
me Pablo for [as long as I've been processing language.][1] So I answer to
both, and feel like I am both.

It may surprise you to know that some people have actually been emotionally
invested in how I approach this issue. Enough that I felt compelled to write
about it. Weird.
