<em><small>Originally written on December 18, Newtown hit me very hard, then I
got wrapped up in holidays. Actual publish date is January 4.</em>

tl;dr I still believe <a href="http://morepaul.com/2010/08/making-living-being-artist.html">all this</a> 
but feel people who watch game streams with
ad block are acting supremely entitled because there are workarounds, and
compared to "theft" of mass media the inconveniences are fewer, and the producers
are more cheated.</small>

I got into a Twitter disagreement with a good friend, [Jake Eakle][1], mostly
over this tweet of mine:

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote><p>Considered working in eSports when I

To which he responded:

<blockquote><p>@<a

And I:

<blockquote><p>@<a

And he:

(I'm not putting this on twitlonger, because I prefer the data in my own space).

So I promised a rebuttal in a similar long-form vein as the Twitlonger post:

<blockquote><p>@<a

<blockquote><p>@<a

and here it is!

<h3>Summary, and a brief aside.</h3>
First, I still agree with [all this][2]. No use arguing right vs. wrong on these
questions, prefer working over non-working, and in the case of mass media assets
like pop music, Hollywood movies, and royalties for scripts, the current system
is _not working_.

Note that this doesn't mean _I_ would pirate or endorse pirating: my 
opinions in the previous post were concering a proper attitude as a producer 
trying to make a living, not the morality or a judgement on the person obtaining
the assets. I didn't state my opinion of that person or their actions.

Here's where the two posts differ: in the tweet that set it all off, I was
stating my opinion, at least as in concerns game streams, and more clearly so we
don't miss it: **given the state of media, if you're running an ad blocker 
during a stream, you're being entitled (in my opinion, unjustly) to free 
entertainment and the labor of artists.** And, well, I think it's a dick move,
so I don't do it, and hope you don't either.

That said, here's why it's a more complicated situation for me than the standard
case of mass media, where I'm much more forgiving.

<h4><em>This</em> system works for artists, actually.</h4>
In the last post, I hinted at the fact that the last system didn't only provide
inferior service for consumers, but cheated artists as well:

<blockquote>A fringe benefit of this is that you no longer have to deal with
middlemen taking big cuts, and stealing. Hollywood accounting means that you
could still, technically, 
<a href="http://blastr.com/2010/07/11-biggest-sci-fi-blockbu.php ">lose money on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a> 
(Peter Jackson and the estate of JRR Tolkien had to sue to get any royalties from the
movies). It’s how TLC 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041010081842/http://mbhs.bergtraum.k12.ny.us/cybereng/nyt/rapper01.htm ">could sell 10 million CD’s and still go bankrupt.</a> 
The bad old days were bad for artists too. So leverage the technology, and work for
yourself.</blockquote>

See the Wikipedia page for [Hollywood Accounting][5]

In game streaming, these "highway roberry" practices by middlemen are much 
harder to perform than in traditional entertainment spheres. So when Warner 
Bros. or Sony Music tell me that I'm stealing from Rihanna, I know they've got
her and every other one of their artists on a short leash, and I'm _actually_
stealing from Hollywood fatcats who give them fractions of a penny of my $20 CD
or DVD purchase.

(note: the not-incorrect theory is, those "fatcats" actually need to be there
for the work to get made at all, and deserve their share of the money too. Sure,
okay. Certainly the _creation_ of art isn't enough on it's own, and there's a
whole industry around packaging, marketing, distribution, and the like. I'll 
expose my bias for content creators here: I can't prove that a system where they
get more of the money for their work is "better" since creation is only part of
the process, so I'll just state I have an emotional preference for rewarding 
content creators, at least more than the current system does).

Given this, I feel a fair bit worse running AdBlock while watching 
[Grubby's stream][8] because it means mah boi Manuel is losing more money for
entertaining me (for FREE mind you... but that's later) then I would be 
depriving Kanye were I to downloaded his entire life's work, proportionally
speaking.

(SECOND note: this doesn't mean [Twitch.tv][6] or [Owned3D][7] don't take a cut
here. They're the fatcats. But that cut _is_ substantially less, since a) they
are in in direct competition with each other (and tomorrow's startup) in a
low barrier-to-entry market, and therefore can't collude as effectively ("it's just how
it's done" can't be pulled off), and b) they're calculating artist compensation
by automated processes based on precise measurements like ad impressions.
Hollywood accounting is possible when you can make a few "big scores", for which
you need a legal team to create a confusing contract based on fungible 
definitions, and an accounting team to enforce it... Basically, yes, they take
money, but they're playing a game that only works when they create a system 
where it is **much** harder to screw you).

So while I don't do it, I **don't** feel that "stealing" from the big labels in
traditional media is the same as stealing from the artist, but in game streams,
it's much, much closer; close enough to give me pause. That said, if you're 
still so annoyed by the ads...

<h4>Put your money where your mouth is and <em>subscribe.</em></h4>
If you click the link to Grubby's stream above, you'll notice a Subscribe button
for $4.99. This means you watch that stream ad-free for a month, and give the
streamer a bigger payout per-user than they get via ad impressions. So if you _really_
wanted to watch ad-free and weren't afraid of participating in capitalism (where
_both_ the producer and consumer benefit from a transaction) why is this option
never mentioned in the comments to threads on AdBlock?

A big reason I don't own a TV or subscribe for cable is because I watch streams
regularly enough that I wouldn't use it. If a basic cable subscription costs $60
(that's conservative, from what I hear/remember) you can support 12 streamers 
for that cost and watch 12 streams without ads, ever (cable subscriptions often
cost more, especially with HBO, sports packages, &amp;etc.)

I have no data for the premise that few people subscribe, for all I
know it's a very popular feature and tens/hundreds of thousands of users do it.
I'm skeptical though, because it virtually never gets mentioned in any threads 
about AdBlock, and all the people who know AdBlock is costing [TeamLiquid][10]
[50-60% of their ad revenue][11] never mention or seem to care that all their
grievances for watching ads could be remedied with the cost of a fancy drink at
Starbucks.

I know not everyone is a software developer like me who can afford the cost of
of a cable subscription, but if you still choose to just block the ads, also 
remember...

<h4>It's a growing industry.</h4>
Not to become the "STOP KILLING ESPORTS" kid, but... if you like eSports, why
are you engaging in a practice that actively hurts its business prospects? It's
a brand new form of mass entertainment, still on pretty shaky ground, and this
bubble could still pop. Just ask [Jason Lake][14] or 
Alex Garfield or [Marcus Graham][13], because they lived and invested in 
a world of $500,000 Counter-Strike tournaments, only to watch the whole thing 
pop around them.

(Here's a great [interview with Jason Lake][15], where he mentions "the old 
guard" of eSports. Included because, again, the scene has gotten this big 
before, and collapsed hard. You could similarly ask Koreans how 
[MBC Game][16] is doing...)

I think voting with your wallet is mad effective, and when someone creates a
good or service that I like, I see no issues with purchasing that good or 
service if the price is reasonable. And while I was pretty happy before video 
game streaming was a thing, but I'm much happier with it. So I think you should
turn off the AdBlocker if you think the price is reasonable. What was that price
again? Oh right, it's

<h4>30 fucking seconds.</h4>

Like I said before, this post is less logical than the "works vs. doesn't" post
from before, and more opinion as to "why it's entitled." I've tried to make a 
persuasive case as to why this has different feels from the traditional media 
piracy argument: namely, this hurts the artist more directly, we have an opt-out
that still supports artists, and the artists we're punishing happen to be 
pushing the frontiers and forgoing more stable livelihoods for something that 
doesn't have to exist, entirely for my entertainment. But here's where it gets
the most opinion-ey, and where it motivates me to call most of those people from
the thread whiners and asscactuses:

**It's minutes of ads for hours of entertainment, for no money at all.**

_Nowhere else_ do you get this value proposition: you can pay out the ass to for
a movie to be entertained for two hours (with non-blockable ads at the start) 
that barely support artists onscreen; you pay for a cable subscription to have
the privilege to watch a sitcom episode with 23 minutes of content and 7 minutes
of commercials. 

Or you can watch a minute or two of ads for every 30-40 minutes of game? Is it
really that painful? _You're getting this for free, and it's available all the
time._

I agree it can be annoying as hell sometimes: I scream at my monitor when it
doesn't work (sound on ads never works as it should, pre-roll means you can miss
something interesting, repetitive ads, glitches mean the ad never runs but the 
screen blocker does... oh I could go on), but really, you'll just stop 
supporting an industry and its risk-taking content creators whose growth has 
contributed to some of the best entertainment you've had in your 20-odd years 
because you _can't stand_ a minute of pre-roll ads?

There's a word for that: _entitlement._

While not specific to Jake's Twitlonger post (he never mentions TeamLiquid or
PPV) it's especially baffling on a site like TeamLiquid, where it's mostly 
_banner ads_ that are getting blocked, and triply baffling when you remember the
bloody murder that Starcraft fans cried when MLG went for a pay-per-view model, 
and started charging for HQ streams in 2011. If ads are blocked, where do they 
think the money will come from?

Ultimately, I won't argue over the use cases (pre-roll meaning you can miss
something crucial, bad sound, etc.) because I wholly agree with them being
aggravating. I just don't see how you can miss the greater context enough to
think it's worth blocking ads.

<h4>Specific responses to weak sauce from the Twitlonger</h4>
Just picking at some straggling lines, things that made me "wat" a little:

<blockquote>"Sure, I don't *have* to be able to do that. But since I can for
free, I'm going to."</blockquote>

If we didn't have an effective police force, I very well could assault, thieve,
and pillage from you because there'd be no governing law to stop me.

And I agree with you! It would be more effective for people to form a police 
force than to simply tell me to stop.

It doesn't make me less of a dick, or not entitled, since I've still taken 
people's shit and they had no say in it. While the stakes are lower, it remains
an unpersuasive argument -- it's like people saying if one doesn't believe in God,
why would anybody be good if there's no Hell and Judgement to fear?

Because we want to be good -\_-

<blockquote>"And since I'm going to, it just makes sense for twitch to build
their ad model such that I can keep giving them money while I do
it."</blockquote>
Agreed, as per above re: police force. But know if Twitch/Owned and the scene as
a whole continues, it'll be _despite_ your consumption of the product, not 
_because_ of it, and that just seems twisted to me, especially since we like the
work they do.

I'll bet nobody wants the sound on their ads to work as much as they do, but
the fact that they haven't fixed it yet suggests there might be more to the
problem than appears at first blush (software is like that, natch).

Finally, it's questionable whether "I don't like your price/model, but I like
your good, so I'll take it by my terms because I can get away with it in this
case" is really ethical in the general case.

<blockquote>"This really isn't a defense of my actions."</blockquote>
I find it very odd that when I ask why you do this, you provide a not-defense of
your actions. But I think it signals something else, which I'll get to next...

<blockquote>"feel free to think I'm a freeloader and hate me for
it."</blockquote>
Oh, I definitely think you're being a freeloader. 

Here's the thing: _I think you know it, too_, as per the "not defense" quote. But like
extremely wealthy people who refuse to pay taxes, you've created a mental model
of the world that makes your choices of convenience also Ethically Sound. But
when asked to defend that model, most of what comes out are simplifications, or
non-defenses.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** I absolutely don't hate you for it. I have tons of 
disagreements with my friends over issues with much higher stakes (like the eternal 
fate of my soul, for instance), but don't hate them as people as a result.

<blockquote>"I don't even really disagree."</blockquote>
Then why do you do what you do?

<blockquote>"I just think that time is better spent working out mutually
beneficial solutions."</blockquote>
Why not both? The people at Twitch/Owned know (and care a lot more than you do,
believe me) that they can get much more viewership and revenue from their
existing viewership if they come up with a model that isn't as annoying.
