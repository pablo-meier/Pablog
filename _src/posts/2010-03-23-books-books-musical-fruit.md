    Title: Books, Books, the Musical Fruit

A lot of big-time, [real][1] [bloggers][2] [are][3] [writing][4] [about][5]
their 10 most influential books.  I'll present mine here. Stealing some
terminology: this is my 'gut list,' not my 'I've thought about this for a long
time' list:

**Don Quijote** (_Cervantes_)

<!-- more -->

<img src="/img/2010/03/quijote.png" alt="Picasso's Quijote art" />

'Misfit' entertainment is on the rise: _Napoleon Dynamite_, _Eagle vs. Shark_,
and pretty much everything starring Michael Cera are examples of movies where
we celebrate and flesh out the weirdos, oddballs, and losers of society into
something a little higher. This 'not-like-the-others' quality is all over my
list.

None of them hold a candle to Don Quijote, however. He embodies that cute
Akira Kurosawa line: "In a mad world, only the mad are sane." While you the
reader know he's off his rocker, and that you're "better off" with your mental
state, you can't help but envy him. He's happy as a clam! He's living the
adventure! You can almost always open up to a random point in either of the two
volumes to see Quijote having a good time, and Sancho being completely lovable.

I feel like my connection with this book is like a lot of religious people's
with their Holy Text: I haven't read every word of it, and its been so long
since I read it that I'm probably just taking what I want to remember out of
it. I'm sure my many memories are easily amended and disproven by someone
who's really studied it. But it left enough of a mark on me to bring my dog-eared,
notes-in-the-margin copy everywhere I go.

**Short Stories** (_Jorge Luis Borges_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/borges.jpg" alt="Borges" />

My former Spanish teacher quipped that Borges probably wasn't the most read
Spanish author, but arguably the the most reread. You can see why: his short
fiction is jam-packed with beautiful imagery, contradiction, love and meaning.
They're [Everlasting Gobstoppers][10].

**The White Tiger** (_Aravind Adiga_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/whitetiger.jpg" alt="Cover of The White Tiger" />

A recent addition, I just finished this about a month ago and absolutely loved
it. Murder is one of the most interesting themes in fiction, especially how we
can make someone else killable. The character's progression/descent into
murder in a modern capitalist society is entertaining and evocative.

**Banvard's Folly** (_Paul Collins_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/banvards.jpg" alt="Cover of Banvard's Folly" />

The non-fiction of Paul Collins is some of my favorite reading. This book
concerns 13 people who really thought they were going to change the world,
only to be wrong, subverted, or laughed into irrelevance. Each one is a
treasure chest containing all the right reasons and motivations between
predictably flawed humans.


I'm typical of a lot of Brown students in that failure is something I'm not
used to, and can't confront. I believe one of the most instructive parts of my
education here is to have failed spectacularly on a few instances. You haven't
learned much if you haven't been kicked square in the teeth.

**The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao** (_Junot Diaz_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/junot.jpg" alt="Cover of Junot Diaz's novel" />

Another great [A List Apart essay][17] has a favorite passage of mine:

> Write for a reason, and know why you write. Whether your daily updates concern
> your work life, your hobbies, or your innermost feelings, write passionately
> about things that matter.
>
> To an artist, the smallest grace note and the tiniest flourish may be matters
> of great importance. Show us the details, teach us why they matter. People are
> fascinated by detail and enthralled by passion; explain to us why it matters
> to you, and no detail is too small, no technical question too arcane.
>
> Bad personal sites bore us by telling us about trivial events and casual
> encounters about which we have no reason to care. Don’t tell us what happened:
> tell us why it matters. Don’t tell us your opinion: tell us why the question
> is important.

I find this book to be exemplary of this. I didn't think others would like it
as much as me, since not everyone is a latino nerd like I am (and Mr. Diaz
appears to be). But the book succeeds as wonderful fiction even to those who
don't follow the references. I don't know if I'll ever reach others the way
this book has through _my_ diverse and precise passions, but I'm more inspired
to try.

**CivilWarLand in Bad Decline** (_George Saunders_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/civilwarland.jpg" alt="Cover of CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" />

Most people I recommend George Saunders to (my dad, an ex in particular)
really hate his fiction. But I've always loved it. These are earlier stories
of his, and like _Banvard's Folly_, they tend to be very funny and amazingly
tragic at the same time.

A lot of times you look around and realize how nutty, depressing, and
maddening the world can be: it takes a master satirist to acknowledge this
truth, and get you to laugh about it.

**The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea** (_Yukio Mishima_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/sailor.jpg" alt="Cover of Sailor" />

This book gave me chills for months after I was finished with it. It was like
the nectar of _Crime and Punishment_ wrapped in bacon. Mishima (whose life is
also a wonder to investigate) really puts you in the minds of these
reasonable, ambitious people and confronts troubling issues of psyche.

**The God Delusion** (_Richard Dawkins_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/goddelusion.jpg" alt="Cover of The God Delusion" />

This will get some eye rolls, no doubt. I was something of a skeptic before I
read this, in the closet and afraid about my lack of faith. This book helped
me realize its nothing to be afraid of.

Dawkins frequently gets described as someone who's polarizing, employing
bitter rhetoric, and gets piled in with Christopher Hitchins as a Mean
Atheist. Having actually _read_ his essays and seen him speak, this is really
just a smear. His tone is civil, and he never says anything that can't be
verified. If people think I'm wrong on this, I encourage them to let me know,
and we can talk ^\_^ But I would be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy
this book, and if I didn't mention I wouldn't be as comfortable with who I am
if I hadn't read it.

**Edit \[2013-07-02\]:** I'm reading this now in 2013 (Frog reboot!) and
groaning. It remains for historical interest only. While the book still stands
as having influenced me, and stands reasonably well on its own, Dawkins himself
has become something of a caricature in the last few years. Not really a fan
any more.

**Edit \[sometime in 2011?\]** I spoke too soon. While _The God Delusion_ is
approachable and civil, [Dawkins can be pretty inflammatory.][24] As apology,
listen to Neil DeGrasse Tyson take way too long to
[tell Dawkins to tone it down][25], and [a wonderful remix][26] of the end of
the exchange.

**Introduction to the Theory of Computation** (_Michael Sipser_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/sipser.jpg" alt="Cover of Sipser's work" />

The computer book to end all computer books. Sipser writes masterfully about
computational theory, intent on _teaching_ it to you without just _stating_ it
at you. I would recommend this to anybody, CS or not, who has an interest in
keeping their brain occupied.

**[The Little Schemer][29]** (_Daniel Friedman and Matthias Felleison_)

<img src="/img/2010/03/schemer.jpg" alt="Cover of The Little Schemer" />

How could I have forgotten this blog's former namesake! Teaches programming,
recursion, all the way up to the most elegant and concise demonstrations of
the [Halting Problem][32] and the [Y Combinator][33] that I've ever read, all
in a charming voice. More so than Sipser, worth picking up and playing with
even if you're not a programmer, and the most instructive book (with other,
more general Scheme-powered books like [SICP][34] and [PLAI][35]) on how I
approach programming.

----

Of course, more influential than most of these are theatre performances I've
attended. That'll be another post.

Also, do you see a problem with this list? THEY'RE ALL MEN. I hate that I
haven't read more women.
