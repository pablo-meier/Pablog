    Title: The Gods must be crazy!

Over 60% of the video online containing Paul was only uploaded in the last month.  
Here's another!  I'm acting in [Mt. Olympus][1], a new [Brown TV][2] show with 
some really wonderful people involved.

The premise is that the Greek Gods come down every once in a while from Mt.
Olympus to let off some steam. During one visit, Hestia, who guards the hearth
(and source of their Godly powers) leaves it unattended to take a break, and
their powers vanish! What will they do in as students in a college that looks
suspiciously like Brown?

I play Hermes, the messenger of the Gods. He's a trickster, and mostly serves
as comic relief. The gods go through a number of identity issues when they
lose their powers and learn to become mortal, but Hermes is really just there
to have the best time he can.

There's about 2:40 introduction with the classroom scene. I'm mostly in the
opening sequence after that, until about 5:00. The rest of the episode is
quite fabulous, and I've made lots of great friends working on this. Keep
watching until after the credits for More Paulâ„¢! It was that clip that left my
family speechless when I got the rough cut of it over Spring Break.

Also, some of the music (namely the party music that comes in when I enter the
dark room at 3:20) was done by a very talented friend I met at Brown, Mr.
[Andrew Underberg][5]. I remember asking him for a recording of his midterm
project in [an Electronic Music class we took][6] 4 years ago, because it
really stood out as excellent (sadly, I can't find it on his site and lost it
in a hard drive death...).

(also, I've updated [the post on the Pope and Catholicism][7], providing
reasons why I am so angry, with lots of links substantiating my original
sentiment).
