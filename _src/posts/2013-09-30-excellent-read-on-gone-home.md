[Ian Bogost][1] just published [my favorite piece written about Gone Home][2]
so far. An excerpt:

> There is an idea among the game-playing and development communities that games
> can be stories with interactivity, and that such new types of stories are going
> to “broaden the audience” for games. But this is a flawed idea, because a
> broadened audience would mean an audience amenable to such new material in the
> context of their existing tastes. If that gap is not acknowledged and addressed,
> then we end up with games as bad television shows and novels; bad television shows
> and novels with button pressing.
>
> Then again, what if Gone Home teaches us that videogames need only grow up
> enough to meet the expectations other narrative media have reset in the
> meantime? After all, we’re living in an age in which the literary mainstream is
> dominated by young adult fiction anyway. Adults read series like Harry Potter
> and Twilight and The Hunger Games with unabashed glee. Comic book film
> adaptations have overtaken the cinema. What if games haven’t failed to mature so
> much as all other media have degenerated, such that the model of the young adult
> novel is really the highest (and most commercially viable) success one can
> achieve in narrative?
>
> As the designer Merritt Kopas said of Gone Home, “This is a videogame. About
> girls in love. That shouldn’t be exceptional in and of itself, but it is.” And
> there’s the rub. Because Kopas is right: the fact of the game’s very existence
> becomes more important than its aesthetic ambitions. Such is the remaining
> not-so-hidden secret of Gone Home, a game about not-so-hidden secrets: that
> media must struggle against increasingly strong rhetorical currents to have even
> a chance at spawning a modicum of expression before dying off.

I'm extremely tickled that ["gamers"][3], on the whole, seem to hate it, and
secretly think that fuels a large part of why I love it.

But if I'm being honest, _Gone Home_ was an enjoyable few hours, but not a whole
lot more. The critical fawning is understandable to me, but I didn't share the
experience.

Looking forward to more great work by The Fullbright Company, though. They
impressed me heavily with their [strong statement][4] on PAX and Penny Arcade.

Also, [another great piece by Ian Bogost][5] on the Facebook Platform, touching
on unfortunate trends of software development as a whole and Silicon Valley in
particular.
