    Title: Good Music

I've been hitting some hard times this last year, namely aftershocks of 
[my sister's illness][1], as well as personal/relationship troubles which may or
may not be related. It isn't the purpose of this blog to delve into them, I'd
rather share the better parts of my life, and part of that is the music that
helps lift one out of the blues.

Two pieces I discovered in the interim time period that are simply phenomenal
recordings:

**Christian McBride**

_Night Train_ - from the album _Gettin' To It_

A solo bass performance (Jazz).

**Michael Cleveland and Flamekeeper**

_Jerusalem Ridge_ - from the album _Leavin' Town_

A fiddle and mandolin duet (Bluegrass).

A few notes:

* I'm providing links to the iTunes store. Obviously I can't stop you from
downloading them illegally, but I recommend you purchase them. At 99 cents,
it's not much, and these are both living musicians trying to make a living
_today_ in genres that aren't very popular. **These guys are clearly doing it
for love of music.** Also, the YouTube versions of these songs are generally
terrible, if applicable.

If you must 'try before you buy,' iTunes gives you a 30 second preview.
Alternatively, if you buy them and hate them, (and you're a friend of mine) I
can give you two bucks back.

* Listen to them _loud_. They're both string pieces, and ideally you'll
listen to the loud enough to hear after-pluck resonances (in one of them, you
can even hear the artist breathing). You won't regret it ^\_^

* As with most (strangely, not all) music, you'll get more out of it if you
listen purposefully. Clear your mind, hit play, and let it sink to you


Naturally, I also love the music of my brother [Robert Meier][5]. He's the
bassist on [two][6] [albums][7] by very talented composers he went to school
with, give it a look ^\_^.
