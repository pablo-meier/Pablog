I just got back to work after a lovely, lovely break, and will get back to
blogging Real Things soon.  In the meantime, recording a milestone:

I had what I like to think of my "first" "release" of [ScrabbleCheat][1]. In a
match of Scrabble without it, Madly Brilliant beat me by 97 points. I used it
successfully for the first time (with her knowledge and permission) and beat
her the following game by about 83 points. There's still tons of work to be
done, but its core is there, certainly.

I learned a ton from writing it, and hope to create a few animations/blog
posts about it in the near future. This flowchart to writing [Good Code][2],
by xkcd, is relevant, mostly in relation to the quality differential between
the hacktacular client code and less hackey server code.
