I can write about Spring Weekend a bit later (this was the first and last time
I'll do Spring Weekend as a student). In the meantime, I'll procrastinate by
posting another favorite video. Sadly for you _gringos_, you have to speak
Spanish to glean much meaning from it:

I used this as the basis for [my first major project][1] in an Electronic
Writing course I took last year. Other works I did for the course are on [the
course wiki][2], my work including a [programmatic riff][3] on [_Pierre
Menard_][4], (this also used a [text generator for grammar files][5] I coded
up), and [my final project][6].
