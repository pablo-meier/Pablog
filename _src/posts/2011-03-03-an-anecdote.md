I once saw Tony Kushner speak (playwright, author of [Angels in America][1] and
[Caroline, or Change][2], among other things).   During his talk he mentioned a
cute litle anecdote to illustrate how he felt about [Dramaturges][3] in the
playwriting process.

The story went something like this:  a friend of his was given a playwriting
grant, but a condition of the grant was to work with a professional dramaturge on
each draft of the work.  Said friend hated collaboration, and especially didn't
like the dramaturge assigned to him.  So before the first draft was due, he wrote
his first draft.  He also wrote his second draft.  For his first deadline
with the dramaturge, he handed him the first draft.

And every subsequent due date, the dramaturge would be one draft behind the
author. The dramaturge would send his notes for draft *n*, the author would throw
them away, work on draft *n + 2*, and send the dramaturge the already-existing
draft *n + 1* at the next due date.

As far as we know, the dramaturge never caught on.
