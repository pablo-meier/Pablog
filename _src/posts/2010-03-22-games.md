Made two demo videos, for my [Independent Study making games.][1]  The first was our
collaborative effort, a Hungry Hungry Hippos-type game called _Penguins_:

The second was a Tetris Attack knockoff I call FlipTile, which I did on my own
just for kicks one weekend. I hope to take it far, but time! TIME!!!

I rather enjoy Android dev, and game dev in particular. Maybe I can pursue
this?

After working on these videos, I'm tired of hearing my own voice. I need to
make another one of these tonight, chances are I'll use an accent.

Finally, I might dedicate a future post to the Fail that is iMovie. Apple
recovered the computer market in the early 2000's with OS X, and one of the
major plugs was the package that was later packaged as iLife. iMovie used to
be a major perk of migrating, but since they branched the two to iMovie (free)
and iMovie HD (which they now sell!), the free one is full of bugs and anti-
features.
