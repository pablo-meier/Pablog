A few things.  One, **cursing, and strong words!**

I happen to agree.  I swear very little, and do so very carefully (which is to
say I treat swear words like any other word). But still, someone who thinks
they have _no place_ has never seen them put to great use (my favorite example
is still the [Pope Song][1]).

Slurs, on the other hand, are pretty awful. I handle how I feel about these
case by case. I happen to think, like swearing, we put too much weight on
these as a society, but that's easy when you're tall, skinny, straight, and
pass for white like I do. Normally I'm happy to leave well enough alone. But
this Daily Show clip wins.

Finally, I love 2010. First you get this story on the news:

Which, naturally gets remixed:

But here's the best part: a school picked it up and playing it for marching
band!

Are we lucky to be alive now, or what?
