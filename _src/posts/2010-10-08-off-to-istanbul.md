I'm off next week to visit Madly Brilliant in her current home of Istanbul, Turkey.
She's abroad for the first time, spending 5-ish months as a lab tech,
so my visit bisects hers. Mad props to Adobe for letting me do this ^_^


(by the way, we just [released the AIR Runtime for Android][1]! Download it
onto your phone now, and enjoy mobile AIR apps ^_^)


Of course, I'm visiting during [a terror warning.][2] Surprisingly, I'll
describe my reaction with [a meme][3]:


[![][4]][5]


[Bruce Schneier][6] (from 2004!) and [Slate][7] highlight why this is so.


Also, the [last show I sound designed][8] at pw used Fly Me To The Moon as a
recurring musical motif. So when I heard this, at first I was like "Hmm..."
but then started grooving contentedly:

I have a very colorful, mixed relationship to the theatre that produced the
show (I was on the board). Still, they have a wonderful little wiki where [I
made and defaced a profile page.][9]


Away I go!
