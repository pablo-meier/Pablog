Still studying like a madman for Neuroscience, but took a few minutes to catch up on
some news.  First, a co-creator of Flash [makes the best defense of Flash][1] as
a platform [contra Steve Jobs][2] I've seen, many echo my
sentiments exactly. Some money quotes (emphasis mine):

> I think Steve Jobs is willfully missing a key point with his arguments
> against Flash. **The important reason to put Flash on the iPhone is that
> millions of developers have invested millions of hours building Flash content
> in Flash. The Flash content out there in the world is an asset of our society
> and the people who created it.** People built it in Flash because there was no
> other decent technology from companies like Apple, Microsoft or Real Networks
> that enabled this kind of content to be created and delivered. To say that all
> this content should be discarded because Steve Jobs is afraid that people will
> build Flash content that runs on mobile devices running any operating system
> instead of building content that will only work on Apple mobile devices is
> doing a disservice to the efforts of all those individuals.

> Personally, I think that Flash content will probably outlive iPhone and iPad

On Apple's devices as a whole:

> The iPhone/iPad model certainly has some of the appealing traits of the

Apple aside: yes, I've read [Designing with Web Standards][3], and absolutely
believe in the future of a better Internet, one that is standards-based, with
fewer applications relying on closed, commercial plugins.

_But_, if it's a challenge for _me_, a Computer Science concentrator at a top
university, to use a programmatic technology that's only been available for a
few years (HTML5) to make even a simple graphic react to the most basic inputs
that will only work for some browsers... well, it's no surprise that a company
filled in the void for rich content, and that designers flocked to it in
droves.

Throw all this in with Apple, who have their own crummy record of openness,
supporting developers, and economic interests and well... I'm not buying most
of Jobs' arguments.

(Adobe isn't excused from this either, mind you: they are also driven
primarily by profit motives, and Flash as a technology certainly has its
flaws. Yes, they are guilty of not being perfect, but I think Apple is
currently more guilty of willful, opaque obstruction, and do more harm to
developers and ultimately end users).

The other major story was that [Facebook and Zynga have entered a formal
agreement.][4] Facebook is a company I've been thinking a lot about these
days. As a game developer, game player, and privacy/civil liberties
enthusiast, Facebook and Zynga's [recent][5] [turmoils][6] have been a hot,
hot topic for me.


(another great post is [Diaspora's curse][7], on why the author believes (and
I agree) that Diaspora is doomed to fail, unfortunately).
