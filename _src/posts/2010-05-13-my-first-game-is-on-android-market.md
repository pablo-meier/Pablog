Pick it up!  I don't know of a way to link to the market itself (unless you're 
on an android phone, in which case, [click here!][1]).  If you search 'Rat
Race' from your phone, it's the only app that comes up.

It's free! Download it, upvote it, downvote it, PLAY IT, whatever you like ^_^

(short update, finals are the death of me... hopefully for the last time!).
