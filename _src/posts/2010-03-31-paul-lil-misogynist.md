The longer I'm away from home, the more I forget about where I come from.  I'm
on Spring Break now, and usually when I'm home I spend some time digging
around the house for archiving material. During my last Spring Break I put
[some kiddie pictures on Facebook][1] that was met with much enthusiasm from
my family. This time, I have a video.

My school had a tradition of putting 4th graders in little skits, and I was in
one called _Sammy Carducci's Guide to Women._ (based, as I just found out, on
a terrible-looking [novel for middle schoolers][2]).

The director of these shows recorded them, and gave to me a DVD he'd made as a
graduation gift.

The second half of the scene is below (the first half is out of focus, you
need to wait a few seconds on what I've embedded below). Lord, what a strange
thing to look back on.

Highlights are at 2:13 (I make some really amazing, kind of demonic throat
sound), and the freak out at 3:10.

Transcript of the scene appended at the end...

----

Unrelated, but cool links I found this morning: [a concise prediction][3] I
agree with on where computers are headed (differentiating between 'people'
computers and 'geek' computers).

[Bullet points][4] on why smart people fail to be successful. While the choice
of words is muddy, I found a lot of his points resonated with me. Arguably the
best thing I learned at Brown was the hard experience of occasionally failing,
which was absolutely necessary to (stealing his jargon) 'leave the sandbox.'

Finally, having front-end web dev skills went from being able to navigate
[awful w3schools tutorials][5] into a proper science of its own. Even if you
know CSS and basic Javascript, there's pitfall after pitfall in the trenches
of the real world. I found [this list of requirements for new hires][6] to be
a good primer on what are contemporary considerations.

For the record, I tried adding these to the video, but YouTube captioning is a
mess of horrors. Vimeo doesn't even support it, lame sauces.

As promised, the transcript:

**Sammy** Here, I'm gonna give you some background information on women. You
might want to take notes.

**Gus** Uh, notes? Oh, did I show you my new pen? It writes in four different
colors! What color do you think I should use? Maybe red, because it's like
blood! But my brother likes green. Some people like blue, but black is easier
to read!

**Sammy** Oh, Gus, are you finished?

**Gus** Red, definitely red!

**Sammy** Try to concentrate.

**Gus** Hey, this thing is jammed!

**Sammy** Okay, first off, women tend to cry a lot.

**Gus** (writing) Cry. A. Lot. Is this okay?

**Sammy** Yeah, fine. Most of the time all they do is think about mushy romantic
stuff. They do things like write letters to Mel Gibson, and memorize the
lyrics to their favorite love song. Women are always going on diets, but they
have this uncontrollable urge to bake chocolate chip cookies. It's one of the
mysteries of modern science. Women are always in groups, so they have someone
to listen to while they **inaudible**, which is all the time. And when they're
not together, they're usually on the phone. Basically, they're weak, and
they're looking for someone strong. That's where the two of us come in. Okay,
you got that so far?

**Gus** Yeah.

**Sammy** WHAT IS THIS?

**Gus** Oh, its a rocket ship taking off into outer space, see!? The rocket ship
is black, the earth is green, the sky is blue, and the rocket's flames are
red.

**Sammy** GUS!

**Gus** This pen is great for rocket ships!

**Sammy** Let's try a new topic, huh?

**Gus** Can I still take notes?

**Sammy** Yeah, but you might want to start a new page.

We're gonna call this "Tips for Impressing Women." Okay, number 1, NEVER ever
carry an umbrella. It's a sign of weakness.

**Gus** Hey, I never knew that!

**Sammy** Number 2, always use an after shave, even if you don't shave. Number
3, never say "I don't know."

**Gus** But what if you don't know?

**Sammy** Pretend you do. Number 4, talk in a low, soft voice. This is called
the Voice of Love. Women go nuts for it!

**Gus** What does it sound like?

**Sammy** Umm... I'll do it for you later. I don't want anyone to bother me
right now. And number 5, and this is the very most important one of all. "Dare
to be different."

**Gus** You mean look preppy like you do?

**Sammy** No! That wouldn't be different, that would be the same!

**Gus** So how do you know what to do?

**Sammy** It's up to you. That's the whole point. Come on, let's get on with the
survey.

**Gus** _inaudible_

**Sammy** Just take notes! We're going to be checkout out the women in the
cafeteria and looking for things that might be important. I tell you, and you
write it down. For instance, stuff that would drive you crazy.Like Marsha
Brennan would be fine, but has that habit of picking her ear with a paper
clip. Debbie Watterstein's great, until she laughs, and sounds like a pig. And
that one over there, she's way too skinny, and the person she's with, she's...

**Gus** Sammy?

**Sammy** She's beautiful! GUS! GUS GUS! SHe's looking at us.

**Gus** What are you doing?

**Sammy** Just nod and smile! Pretend we're like student architects checking out
the building.

**Gus** Hey! Quit chewing on my pen! You might have germs!

**Sammy** "Yes! Of course! I see!"

**Gus** You see what?

**Sammy** She looked away, we're clear. C'mon, let's go get candy bars.

**Gus** But what about the survey?

**Sammy** It's FINISHED!
