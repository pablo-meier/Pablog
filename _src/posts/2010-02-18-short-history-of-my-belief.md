    Title: A short history of my belief

One of the (few) things I used to blog about was my atheism.  Since I'm starting
fresh in this new blog, an introduction is in order, since my relationship to
belief has varied widely over the years, and religious belief is something I
care passionately about.

I 'came out' as atheist almost as soon as I embraced the label, about 2 years
ago, in my junior year at Brown. I'd been fighting doubts in my mind for a few
years prior, but only really challenged and criticized my faith with any vigor
or curiosity around when I came out.

I was raised culturally Catholic: technically my mother _was_ a Catholic and
my father a Protestant. I say _was_ because my mother isn't technically
allowed to practice anymore: she is my father's second wife. Since the
Catholics don't believe in divorce, my mother could no longer 'officially'
practice. When they got married, there wasn't a Catholic priest in town who
would officiate the ceremony. They now attend a Methodist church.

We didn't grow up going to church, but I was still raised with a significant
religious bent, in spirit more than ceremony. My parents always emphasized
Doing the Right Thing that Christ Would Want as more important than saying any
number of Hail Marys. In Middle School especially I would pray every night
before going to bed. I would wear a cross, and if I took it off before
showering, would apologize to God.

As I got older, questions started forming. First, the simple facts-on-the-ground
ones ("why does the church hate gay people?") to the higher level ones
("If God knows what I'm going to do, and even controls it, why does s/he
care?"). They mounted over time, and after a while I just couldn't think about
it anymore.

When Junior year rolls around, I read a few books, and realize the answer to
all those questions is a very simple one: **S/he doesn't exist. Suddenly,
almost all the issues go away.**

No more fighting my brain; no more defending stupidity manifesting itself in
religious institutions. No more tainting my observations with false
expectations of a Watcher or Creator. What happens on Earth is our own doing.
**It remains the most liberating moment of my life.**

**It can be depressing, however.** Dawkins had an cute essay called [Gerin
Oil][1], where he compares religion to drug use (paraphrasing: "in light
doses, it's rather harmless and often used as a social lubricant. In heavier
doses...").

I think this is apt. Just like consuming substances can 'turn off' a part of
your brain and allow you certain associated comforts, going atheist is like
being the sober guy at a party. While other people are comfortable embracing
blatant contradictions and living by hollow aphorisms, you get a far less
sugar-coated view. Preventable injustices happen (no, God didn't want it). You
aren't that special. When you die, it's over.

All things considered, however, I'll take it, because a) if you look at it
from another angle, it's not really bad at all, and b) it has the advantage
of being possibly true, or at least doesn't crumble hopelessly after some
nontrivial thought.

So I might post about religion from time to time. If you agree, great! If you
don't, better! Let's have a conversation.
