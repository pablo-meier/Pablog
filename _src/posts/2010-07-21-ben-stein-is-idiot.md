It's my blog, so I'm free to feel smug and righteous as I like.  Today, I'll target Ben
Stein, mostly because a  few days ago [he said][1]:

> The people who have been laid off and cannot find work are generally people
> with poor work habits and poor personalities. I say “generally” because there
> are exceptions. But in general, as I survey the ranks of those who are
> unemployed, I see people who have overbearing and unpleasant personalities
> and/or who do not know how to do a day’s work. They are people who create
> either little utility or negative utility on the job. Again, there are
> powerful exceptions and I know some, but when employers are looking to lay
> off, they lay off the least productive or the most negative. To assure that a
> worker is not one of them, he should learn how to work and how to get along --
> not always easy.

Something was amiss though, and that's this: [a little business editorial he
wrote in 2009][2] for the NYT that said, among other things:

> NOT long ago, a woman in California called me for advice. She is divorced,
> with two children, and has a series of interlocking financial problems.
>
> She lives in a lovely home in a stylish inland enclave. It has an interest-
> only mortgage of about $2.2 million that requires a payment of $12,000 a

> it’s now worth anything remotely close to that price.

Yes kids, Ben Stein thinks unemployed people in the worst recession in US
history since the Depression are, on the whole, lazy grumpy people who deserve
no benefits (we just extended them, thankfully).

But last year, he knew a sweet woman who doesn't work, living off her ex-
husband in a 2 million dollar home receiving $20,000 a month. She has a
current "beau" who'd been paying her credit card debt and incidentals. And
there's his son, recently married and with no other support but his father.
These are _sad tales of desperate Americans._

Of course, all this is a product of a recession caused by subprimes [he
said][3] would "blow over and the people who buy now, in due time, will be
glad they did."

Let's also not forget that he "starred" and "wrote" [the Creationism
documentary][4] that failed by almost every observable metric.

[Like Bill Kristol][5], this guy has a staggering habit of being wrong and
unhelpful, on everything. The fact that he still gets _paid_ for his opinion
or presence is staggering.
