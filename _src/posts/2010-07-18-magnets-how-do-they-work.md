Let this be a myriad post with some of the trends that currently come up in this blog:

**Music.**  This was shown to me  by a former roommate, and while acapella isn't
normally my thing, I found this pretty hip:

**Internet lulz.** I never really cared much for Insane Clown Posse (see [this
lame interview][1], where they manage to make _Bill O'Reilly_ look like the
slightly saner party). I had never been exposed to this, a 2009 release that
compares to Brokencyde in claw-your-facedness:

What makes this more notable is the [meme arising from][2] the line _"Fucking
magnets, how do they work? And I don’t wanna talk to a scientist; Y’all
motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed."_

_Murrrrrrrrr._

(**edit:** Madly Brilliant throws me the link to an [SNL parody][3] of the video,
which I found sufficiently lulzy).

**Programming languages.** I like the tone and content of Mozilla's ["A re-
introduction to Javascript."][4] While I don't love everything Douglas
Crockford writes, but I agree with him in that there's a beautiful language
trapped deep inside Javascript trying to get out. This helps us get there.

Also, reddit has started [a mini-course on programming language math and
formal specification/semantics][5]. While it's too early to tell how
successful it will be, I'm rooting for it!

I have lots more to write about in the coming days: soon I move to San
Francisco, and I just took a trip to the Midwest. Now though, I have to pack!
