**UPDATE (7/20/10):**  A little old, but [Ebert closes the book][1] by saying that,
while he still thinks he's right, he shouldn't have brought it up in the first place.
He essentially says "I'm not wrong, but I can't explain why I feel that I'm right."
It's actually a pretty nice piece.

I [wrote about][2] Ebert et. al. being naive and/or lame when they don't allow
games to be art. This great little reddit thread ["Saddest moment in a
game?"][3] shows that, like [the NYT summarizes rather well][4], it's more a
generational misunderstanding of what 'art' should mean rather than one rooted
in any actual thinking. See how many you've encountered yourself!

At the very least, I see how deficient I am for not having played any Metal
Gear Solid beyond the first (which was _excellent_). Also glad Majora's Mask
is [getting a fair bit of love][5] in that thread; it's the masterpiece
nobody's played, like Skies of Arcadia.
