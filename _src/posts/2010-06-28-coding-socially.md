I decided to finally get a [GitHub][2] account, since I've downloaded countless 
great software from it, and think it's about time I joined/gave back. So check out 
[my profile,][3] feel free to be my friend (or follow my project\[s\], whatever 
it is...), and check out my first "release" of a side project, a program to 
[help you cheat in Scrabble!][4]

[Many][5] [other][6] Scrabble cheaters have been written, but _mine_ is in a
silly functional language! Also, I have plans to make it more than just an
anagram/word generator, even though that's all this release contains. You'll
need [an Erlang VM][7] to run it.

I'll also mention I have [a BitBucket account,][8] but no public repositories.
[My video games group][9] used Mercurial, so now that two of us have graduated
we moved our project to BitBucket. I put [Rat Race][10] and [FlipTile][11] on
there as private repos. If you'd like to friend, follow, or want access to
those codebases, let me know ^_^

Finally, though this is on the sidebar, [I'm also on Stack Overflow.][12]

(the pic is my [Gravatar][13], used in all these sites; a picture taken when I
was in Guatemala last year, with much longer hair and a budding beard. I think
it's one of the few pictures that's not unflattering with that style. I look a
bit different now.)
