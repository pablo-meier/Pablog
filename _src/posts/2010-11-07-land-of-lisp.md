    Title: THE LAND OF LISP

It's been a while since I've been able to run through a code book, with life
throwing me so many welcome curveballs since the summer. But I'm finally
taking the time to work through a book like old times; this go-round is with
Conrad Barski's [_Land of Lisp_][1]. I probably wouldn't have gone for it, but
the music video he made was just too cute:

The book is peppered with cute cartoons and a whimsy feel that is endearing,
not overbearing. I highly recommend it, if only for the comics (though working
through the examples is fun, the games you make really highlight Lisp's
strengths).


Some may recall that [I've dabbled in CL before][2]; sadly that affair was
over before it started (curveballs!), but my next project after ScrabbleCheat
will likely be in either Haskell or Common Lisp ^_^


And how goes [ScrabbleCheat][3]? Quite well, actually! The technologically
adventurous can download and play with it now. What I'm working on now is a
simple UI in [ncurses][4], which will probably take another week or two. But
as soon as that's up, the program should not only be functional (which it
mostly is now), but usable!
