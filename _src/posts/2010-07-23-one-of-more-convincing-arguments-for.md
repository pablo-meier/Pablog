... for me, anyways, was the size and scope of everything that has nothing to
do with us.  Statements like _"If the whole history of the universe were
as your arm span, you can eliminate the entire history of humanity with
the scrape of a fingernail."_ (I can't find the official reference, but it's
used in the irrelevant introduction to [this Ruby talk][1], until I can find
the real one).


If God existed, and cared at all about us, why would he also create _so much_
universe, and have it exist for _so much time_?

Even as someone who already feels this way, this graphic surprised me:

You can't see it, but to the left is our Sun. You really need to see [the
original image][4], and note that the Sun is represented by 1 pixel (the image
itself is 10,173 pixels by 2500).

Also remember that the Sun contains _99.99% of the matter in our galaxy._

In a related note, [Pharyngula][5] points us to some video added to Carl Sagan
(kind of) on the matter.
