This video (at least the middle segment on banks, flying) got a lot of coverage
on some programmer blogs about a year ago, I'm glad I finally found it again and
can share it with you all:

When he talks about the "miracle of flying," I tend to feel that way about
computers. Computers/Internet are a complete miracle, and the beautiful thing
about studying Computer Science is that _I know how it's working and can
contribute to it_. Education is the best drug, because the euphoria never
leaves. It's also a great reason to study science (not necessarily at the
expense of Arts/Humanities).
