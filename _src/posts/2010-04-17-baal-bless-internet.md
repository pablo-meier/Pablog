I love remixes, and hope sometime (probably after I graduate) I can get my
lazy bum off the computer chair so I can make a few
myself. Here are a few that I really love (I also link to the original
sources, you should check them out if you get the chance):

**Bale Out** (warning, NOT SAFE FOR WORK) is a remix of [Christian Bale's
massive explosion][1] on the set of Terminator: Extinction. Aside from being
absolutely hilarious, it's a pretty hip dance piece.

**This is Sparta!** is the classic. Thanks, Gerard Butler, for making that
role so damn good ([original][2]) so we could get so much mileage out of it
(more at [Know Your Meme][3]).

**Love and Trolls - Boxxy** takes the theatricality of Boxxy and makes it into
a hell of an expressive piece in its own right. [Know Your Meme covers
Boxxy][4] pretty well. As an aside, my roommate and I see lots of things on
the Internet that gross out or shock many people, and we don't bat an eyelash.
But when I watch the [original][5] [Boxxy videos][6]... man. It's hard to get
through it all.

**Ronald McDonald Insanity**, both the first (above) and [the second][7], are
surreal. Not for everyone, but as a fan of electronic music and noise music,
the kinds of dissonances and textures created (as well as the video cacophony)
are right up my alley. For the curious, they're primarily voice audio overlaid
from established music (like Love and Trolls, which used Ratatat), in this
case from a series of shooter games in Japan. The Ronald McDonald Insanity
songs are [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIop055eJhU&feature=related)
(first) and [here][9] (second).
