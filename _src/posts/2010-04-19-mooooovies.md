I posted these on the last blog, months before I was digitally evicted.
Last summer I participated with some friends in the [48-hour Film Festival][1],
making two movies.

The game works as follows: at the start of the 48 hours, you're given a
character, prop, and line of dialogue that must be present in your movie.
You're also given a genre, with one chance to re-draw if desired.

<!-- more -->

The first, called _Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow!_, was a dry run of sorts, where
we would identify bottlenecks for Game Time. The plan was to do this in 12
hours, we really did it in about 14.

We drew Science Fiction, a salesperson, a wooden spoon, and the line "I
wouldn't go down there if I were you." Understanding the radio address in the
beginning is pretty key: it introduces the Sci-Fi element on which the plot is
based (namely, a drug has been invented that lets someone re-live another
person's experiences with a sample of their hair).

I acted, with a touch of sound design. See if you can spot the errors! I count
two.

For the 'real' movie we made for the festival (_Not All Who Wander_), we drew
Horror, a pot of coffee, an addict named Sonia, and the line "I'm pretty sure
that's not right."

I didn't act in this, I was one of three involved in sound. Being at the end
of the pipeline (sound was done last), it was a hellish few hours, especially
considering all the on-site audio collected during shooting was garbage. I am
proud of the sound work I did on this, but mostly if I remember what the
conditions were.

This one has three major, hard-to-spot production errors. Brownie points if
you can find them, one of them in particular is hilarious.
