My favorite meme these days is the [Y U NO][1] guy.

Best explained by example:

![Y U NO](http://www.morepaul.com/uploads/2011/03/Y_U_NO_beer.jpg)

Basically, it's that man's epic face with a question why someone/something isn't
someone else/something else.

One I made up:

![Y U NO ALANIS](http://www.morepaul.com/uploads/2011/03/Y_U_NO_alanis.png)
