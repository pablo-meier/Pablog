I decided to revisit [ScrabbleCheat][1] (took a break for administrivia), and wrote
[my first Wikipedia article,][2] on the data structure I'm refitting it
with, to celebrate. It's rare that you can write something on Wikipedia that
isn't there, so I had to pounce.

Hope I can keep editing it with diagrams and the like, as it's a little lame
at the moment. Against my better other judgment, I'm still writing it in
Erlang ^\_^

Also, while I do believe in capitalism and it's ability to generate wealth,
here are a few lame things from the last few days:

* This infographic, [What BP could have bought with all the money they
lost][3], is striking. I'm not so shocked that they lost all that money, but
that they had it in the first place. _One_ company was worth all that
cumulative wealth, what are the others who haven't had cataclysmic disasters
worth? And what are they doing with it?

* Then there's this: ["The 400 richest families in America, who saw their
wealth increase by some $400 billion during the Bush years, have now
accumulated $1.27 trillion in wealth."][4] Their tax rate is also the lowest
on record. But hey! They generated wealth, didn't they? Look at the economy
now!

* [Some][5] [graphs][6] visualizing the awful. Guys, something isn't
working.


Forgive the poor sound quality, but this Louis CK bit comes to mind:
