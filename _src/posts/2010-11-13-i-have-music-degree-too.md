Little known fact, but true.  While I took traditional music theory and piano,
I kind of endured that; the degree had a focus on Electronic Music and digital
media production. It was affiliated with the [Multimedia and Electronic Music
Experiments (MEME)][1] program at Brown.


And sometimes I miss creating things with the skills I gathered in it. This
kind of things is pretty awesome:

And while I linked it a long time ago already, it's always nice to have a
refresher:
