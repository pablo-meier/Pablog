The Olympics brought more opportunities for people to be hatin' on Johnny Weir
and his style of performance. I love what he said:  "Every little boy should be
so lucky to turn into me."

And, you know, it's sort of true. How wonderful if we were all so lucky that
we could freely be who we want to\*, without judgement?

I bring this all up because I saw this video yesterday (the action starts at
about 1:08).

If we could only all be so lucky as Johnny Weir and this guy, the world would
be a much more fun, interesting place to be.
