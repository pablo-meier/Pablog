    Title: New Blog

Hi all,

In a financial confusion (new cards invalidate old ones,
internet companies), the former host of morepaul.com dropped me and my site
after a single, spam-collected e-mail.

<!-- more -->

Thanks to Google Cache, I was able to recover most of my posts (though little
of the uploaded content), and have switched to Blogger for now.

In many ways, the change is very good: like when I moved from LiveJournal to
More Paul, I think it's time for a change in tone. In this iteration, I hope
to include:

* Thoughts on Code: You wouldn't know it from my previous blog, but I think about code **a lot**. I'll hopefully include code snippets of puzzles I'm solving, projects I'm working on, etc.

* Thoughts on books, especially relating to code: Like any good programmer, I'm always reading. I hope to keep a list as to what's working for me and what isn't.

This hopefully won't come at the expense of my previous tone, which was
"here's what I'm doing with my life right now." But like the author of [this
great A List Apart essay][1], no technical detail, no matter how arcane, will
be as uninteresting as my previous blog if I care about it enough.

Besides: it's a blog. It's an invitation for vanity. So if I tell you how to
manually curry functions in Scheme with macros, I will, dammit!

More later, let this just be a stopgap. In the meantime, welcome!

(for those who were wondering about the title , it's a reference to [The Little
Schemer][2], a most wonderful book for anyone (of any level) to learn to think
about problems recursively. Near the end you explore some pretty hip
theoretical topics, but you wouldn't know it if I hadn't told you ^_^
