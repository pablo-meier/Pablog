    Title: Making a living being an artist

This blog seems to have veered from [code][1] and [cute whimsy][2] to
[Paul Screed][3] and [Bloviation][4]. Lets add one more post to that list, in part
spurred by [a post by Jason Robert Brown](http://www.jasonrobertbrown.com/weblog/2010/06/fighting_with_teenagers_a_copy.php)
(writer/composer of Parade and The Last 5 Years, among others) that was making
the rounds for a while. You should skim it, but he's basically making his case
for how it's wrong that artists get cheated out of their royalties by technology
by debating the issue with someone who is actively giving away and receiving his
music.

First, a note on the post: it's pretty awful. He picks an inarticulate
opponent to represent the other side, to the point that it's literally Master
Writer vs. Opinionated Teenager. He doesn't contest the more grounded, better-
expressed arguments refuting his own position, or even really acknowledge
their existence. It's as if the only arguments there are are the ones this
girl mentions, and he predictably takes her to town.

Let's make another distinction: this post isn't to say _stealing music is
okay_, it's more to say _royalties are doomed, think of something else._ With
this I mean I won't go into the ethics of downloading music illegally because,
like most discussion on ethics and law, it's just way too hairy. It sounds
like it should be a no-brainer that the proposition "stealing music is wrong"
is true, but a) everyone may have very different definitions of stealing,
particularly when b) music isn't a good or service that easily fits most
tractable economic models for production _or_ consumption, and c) assumes both
speakers agree on a moral or ethical standard, notions of right and wrong, and
fair behavior. So the only problems with "Stealing music is wrong" is
"stealing," "music," and "wrong."

But I _do_ believe **Jason Robert Brown, like most artists who are successful
or wish to be in the traditional sense, are clinging to a model that has
failed and will continue to do so.** That it's not a good idea to cling to an
income that is primarily sustained by royalties. Like newspapers, that model
only made money when people _couldn't opt-out_ of a bad system. You're hedging
your livelihood hoping that people will _choose to opt-in_ to the same bad
system, against a better alternative.

I can't find a link, but I remember a quote from the early days of the
internet, when a 12-year old kid who loved Dave Barry articles would
transcribe them from the newspaper onto his Geocities site: "When someone
destroys your business model not because they hate you, but because they love
you, you know you're in trouble."

And people won't opt-in. The Times of London online [had a 90% drop in
readership][6] after instituting a paywall. The most compelling point the girl
in the post made, which JRB never addressed, was that she literally _couldn't_
access the music legally since you'd need a credit card to buy it online, and
her parents didn't support her passion for theatre.

The act of buying legally itself is also marred with complications. See [this
graphic of watching a pirated DVD vs. a legitimate DVD][7], or read about
[this guy who pirated Starcraft][8], and had to wait two days to play it when
he decided to buy it. While I believe the main reason people pirate is because
they're cheapskates (most people pirating could afford at least some of the
music they pirate, and could cut consumption like in any other market to make
up the difference), it doesn't help that the experience is often _better_ when
you pirate.

Finally, and this goes back to arguing over whether it's "right" or "wrong:"
most people are incredibly confused by this. When CD burning just started, I
offered to make copies of _commercial CD's_ my family bought legally to take
with us to Guatemala, for _us and only us_ to listen to. My mom relented (and
looked at me like a criminal), thinking the act of burning the CD's was the
illegal part (rather than the distribution... and I'm sure some RIAA lawyer
would or can make the case that it is).

So regardless of whether or not what you perceive as stealing feels wrong to
you (phew), even if you were 100% right and you die and go to Heaven and God
himself says "Yes, Jason, you were robbed wrongfully by your brothers on
Earth," it doesn't change the fact that while you were on Earth, your model
was dissolving and you were being made irrelevant. I'm not arguing right or
wrong, I'm arguing working and non-working.

So what should you do instead? Um... well, I don't know. But I'm pretty sure
the solution isn't to stay on a sinking ship.

I can make a few suggestions though, as this generalizes nicely into the hard
problem of how to make a career as an artist. The first step is to accept that
**you _will_ take a pay cut.** You can't keep the salaries and lifestyle you
kept in the bad old days doing the bad old things. This might mean getting a
second (or different) job.

The second thing to remember is branding. You're recordings may not be worth
much anymore because we can now distribute them losslessly to whoever we want.
But there is still only one of _you_, and that scarcity should factor into
your model.

So try using the technology to brand yourself. Form connections. Don't stop
producing and respond to your audience. If you're lucky, you can get as famous
as Radiohead and [give your music away for whatever anyone wants to pay for
it][9]. If you're a little less lucky, you could probably still get well-known
enough to enough people to score a regular job or commissioned work. Ze Frank
did a great [daily show][10] and seems to get regular work, even getting to be
[a speaker at TED][11].

A fringe benefit of this is that you no longer have to deal with middlemen
taking big cuts, and stealing. Hollywood accounting means that you could
still, technically, [lose money on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy](http://blastr.com/2010/07/11-biggest-sci-fi-blockbu.php)
(Peter Jackson and the estate of JRR Tolkien had to sue to get any royalties from the
movies). It's how TLC could sell 10 million CD's and [still go bankrupt.][13]
The bad old days were bad for artists too. So leverage the technology, and
work for yourself.

Many of the same artist survival tactics still apply. Persevere, and
understand the hardest part of the game is not giving up too soon. Picking up
a skill will help you greatly. Like John Goodman said in _Inside the Actor's
Studio_, the most useful advice he got for his career as an actor was to learn
to type, allowing him a stable day job to live off while he worked. That skill
may even supersede your love for your art, as happened to me. At the very
least you will get more perspective of how most normal, non-artists people
think and work.

On an institutional level, I can't recommend enough Brendan Kiley's article
_[10 Things Theatre's Need To Do Right Now To Save Themselves][14]._ It caused
a major splash and proposed a lot of uncomfortable truths. Many artists hated
it, which is precisely the type of reaction an appropriate solution would
generate in such a broken system. Incidentally, and I know this makes me a Bad
Actor, but I'm tired of seeing Shakespeare.


Obviously, easier said than done. But those are my two cents.
