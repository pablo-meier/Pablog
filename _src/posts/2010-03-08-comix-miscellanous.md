    Title: Comix, miscellanous

This weekend I treated myself and bought the first Deluxe Set of [Y: The Last Man][1]
(issues 1-10, I had the second set before by a happy accident). It's
really a marvelous comic, and suggest people take a look at it.

My friend Lyn has [a comic of her own][2], which I also greatly enjoy. I keep
petitioning for the inclusion of another character, and maybe one day my calls
will be met.

Last summer I tried to get a comic going. I considered posting the 1.5 pages I
completed. It was going to be based in the world of the [Catlevania: SOTN][3]
tribute I thought about writing. I may get back to it, in the meantime, here's
the basic 'standing sprite' I drew, both the complete (enlarged, sorry for the
blur) version, and the to-scale evolution using [Derek Yu's Pixel Art guide][4]:

Finally, I can't stop watching this (make sure you full-screen it):

The song is great, if only because it channels chip music. But the animation!
Made with _real wood blocks_ using _old-school stop motion?_ It inspires me to
create.
