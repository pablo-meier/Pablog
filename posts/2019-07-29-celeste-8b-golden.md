    og_description: I recorded myself beat a hard level of Celeste with no deaths. A different one this time!

I'm still, still, playing Celeste, still going for Golden Strawberries 😄
I got the one on 6b [last month][3].

I beat 8b! I got it recorded if you'd like to see it.

Notes:

- The winning run came on, like, attempt 25 or so of that session, so I look a
  bit fed up to start 😛

- I'm a little proud of my "routing" for 1:06; I found a way to use [Neutral
  Jump][6] to avoid having to learn using the Core block.

- My tongue starts coming out at 2:57. I make faces when I play video games
  seriously.

- Favorite part of the run is 3:58. Second favorite part is the jump scare at
  the very end.

I have one more "standard" Golden Strawberry to go: I need to beat the Summit
B-Sides without a death. My lowest run is 40 deaths, in about 15 minutes, so all
in it looks like I need to play without a major mistake for about 13-14 minutes,
after learning the screens.

After that, the hidden strawberry: beating 1a without dashing. You can see
someone do it [here][5]. I'll probably finish around when the DLC comes out,
which looks like it's got [over 100 screens][4].

I highly recommend _Celeste_.
