    og_description: I've watched a lot of movies this summer.

Here's some movies I've seen recently:

### Solo

Eminently forgettable. There's exactly one friend of mine who takes every
opportunity to defend it whenever it's slandered and this fascinates me.

[This article][1] summarizes it very well: _Star Wars_ isn't a universe
conducive to strip-mining of content like the Marvel movies have been. The fun
of _Star Wars_, for me, was about imagining my own adventures with action
figures or reading books like [this one][4] and [this one][5]. Releasing a movie
every 6 months to get a bland Hollywood-ized versions of extremely simple
stories won't succeed. [The first few grafs of this][14] articulate this well.

Some other fun _Star Wars_ takes from a Twitter user I like are [this one about
The Last Jedi and Rogue One][2] and [this short one about Solo][3].

### Won't You Be My Neighbor

I [wrote about][6] my idea of Fred Rogers, and the movie delivers. It's
heartwarming, entertaining, and presents a portrait you're grateful to receive.
Beyond the obvious elements that tell his story, I found a lot to chew on
regarding aging, measuring the impact of one's life, childhood and trauma, and
able to choose the person you want to be.

### Avengers: Infinity War

I'm mostly impressed at the logistics of this movie: _Age of Ultron_
demonstrated that asking 20 doctors to stick their hands in a body under surgery
isn't necessarily a good thing. This movie got made with all those people, and
it's largely coherent.

It's impossible to talk meaningfully about it without talking about the MCU
generally; [this article][7] is probably my favorite.

Re: superhero fatigue, I wrote something on Facebook when a friend asked "Why
doesn't Hollywood make other movies" and figure this is a relevant place to
share it too:

> * Hollywood is, first and foremost, in it for the money. They do whatever
> will net them the most cash, so the art they make isn't optimized for anything
> but that.
> 
> * You will likely get more cash if you can viably target the bigger markets;
> e.g. 30 Rock was absolutely loved by left-liberal city-dwellers but never
> reached Modern Family or The Big Bang Theory audience sizes (by, like, an order
> of magnitude) because a ton of demographics who watch a lot of TV just didn't

> 
> * The general public can't really agree on pretty much anything. "Police
> shouldn't shoot unarmed people," "the President shouldn't base policy on how
> they can personally profit from it," or "fascism is bad" are, apparently,
> divisive statements? The present is weird.

### Lady Bird

</div>

I really, really enjoyed this, cried a few times during. People just want to be
seen.

### Ocean's 8

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/6/oceans_8_THUMB.jpg" alt="Dope cast of Ocean's 8." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

This was good! Entertaining, and worth it alone for Cate Blanchett's wardrobe.
On balance it's not the best thing I saw on this list, which I mostly blame on
structural problems that are inescapable in these reboots, well-articulated
[here.][12] Given those constraints though, I was very impressed.

### Deadpool 2

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/6/deadpool-cable-domino_THUMB.png" alt="RON PERLMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN CABLE." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

(spoiler alert) When I heard [they fridged one of my favorites characters in
Deadpool][11] I got pretty mad; alas, boredom got the better of me and we went
and saw it. Like the first Deadpool, it was way funnier than I thought. If
you're not turned off by violence, I think you'll like it. Especially in the
wave of Disney superhero movies, I like what this offers.

<small>(I would have liked Ron Perlman as Cable)</small>

### A Quiet Place

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

Every time I see John Krasinski I think "he is _such_ a Brown grad!" I mean,
leave it to a Brown grad to [write the screenplay for a David Foster Wallace
adaptation][8] and star as the lead. Fun fact! He [was in the running to be
Captain America][9] before they gave it to [the Human Torch][10].

Anyway, this movie is cute. Didn't blow me away, but well-acted and designed. As
a former sound designer, this was catnip.

### A Wrinkle In Time

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/6/wrinkle-in-time_THUMB.jpg" alt="Excellent cast." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

This was delightful! I think it had a hard time, coming so soon after _Black
Panther_, and folks forgetting it's a movie for all ages. I wish my kid's movies
were this good. [John Scalzi][13] wrote something great about it.

I'll watch Michael PeÃ±a in anything, and look forward to seeing him again in
_Ant-Man and The Wasp_.
