    og_description: I needed a gun character, here are some concepts.

<small><em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkVsJGl5d6E">Candy</a>, by Mandy Moore.</em></small>

I described [Homage][1] and [Gorlif][2], now for something different: a
character I'm actively creating!

I'm about to enter a [Fate][3] campaign, and was late in producing a character.
The GM established the following guidelines:

* The world is 2018, and fairly close to realistic (it'll get Fantastical in
  ways later, but for now, we're to assume it's all brass tacks 2018).

* The party needs someone fight-ey, and in this world, that means full of guns.

* The party isn't directly hired by Blackwater, but some private contractor like
  them (I joked that we get our dispatches via radio, prefaced with "Good
  morning, Angels"). So create a character who would be hired by such a firm.

This goes against a lot of Pablo favorite tropes, but here were some concepts I
threw together:

### The Mike Ehrmantraut idea

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/4/mike_erhmantraut.jpg" alt="Photo of Mike Erhmantraut" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

Per _Breaking Bad_ and _Better Call Saul_, I love the idea of a Mike
Ehrmantraut-type character who's old and hyper competent.

If you don't watch the show, you should know that the actor is 71 years old.
He's a former cop and he moves pretty slowly. He's usually thought things ahead
of time and knows "the game" pretty well. He's frequently underestimated and rarely
in danger. I can't find the full scene, but here's [a short demonstration][4]
where someone who got hired for the same protection job is teasing him for not
carrying a gun (he's not carrying a gun because he did legwork on the dealer
executing the drug trade he's protecting and learned enough to know there won't
be a gunfight).

### The IG-88 idea

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/4/ig88.png" alt="Photo of IG-88" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

The idea is that the party would be accompanied by some kind of experimental
Battle Cyborg - some weapons/DoD project that the mysterious owner got a hold of
somehow. If we have a Hacker in the group this could lead to an interesting
dynamic. They'd be built for combat (so guns, explosive launchers, short-range
welder... I imagine their demo looked something like [the ZF1 from The Fifth
Element][5]).

It can have an independence story a la Short Circuit? Maybe it's a pacifist who
hates that it's programmed to kill? Maybe it makes commentary about other
digital systems (like "ooh, she's sultry" when they see an electric thermostat).

### The Barrett Wallace idea

I always thought Barrett's gun-arm was cool:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/4/barrett-wallace.png" alt="Photo of Barrett Wallace" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

So I might like the idea of someone who went a little too wild with guns and
prosthetics and had detacheable "parts." Maybe she was part of DoD and went a
little wild in the lab, or maybe she was from a backwater town and did it all
herself (and is missing some fingers and/or facial features from when she's
played too much with explosives).

### The Artiste idea

Skies of Arcadia had a great gunslinging character, Gilder:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/4/gilder-skies.jpg" alt="Photo of Gilder. He's got style." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

He was a bit of a playboy, had that very cute parrot, and would yell "[Dance for
Me!][6]" when firing in rapid succession. I'm kind of into the idea of a character
who does it for the style points, names guns, and draws little faces into the
bullets. Maybe mods the guns to make their gunshots in line with certain
pitches. Basically, they're insufferable, but they do make things go BOOM when
needed.

### Explosives dude (the .5 idea)

Some combination of "Left Ear" from The Italian Job and Basher from Ocean's
Eleven, some character who really just identifies with explosives. It's not that
they can't use guns! They'll even have a few! But they'd really rather launch
grenades, set off careful plastic explosions, or engineer smoke bombs.

Don't have as much inspiration for this one though.
