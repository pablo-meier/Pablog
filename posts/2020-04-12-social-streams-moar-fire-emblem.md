    og_description: Come to my Zoom calls, watch me code maybe, and nerding out over Fire Emblem.

<small>ðŸŽµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o2EU5VOzLQ">John Wick Mode</a>, by Le Castle Vania.</em> ðŸŽµ</small>

We've replaced "using my parent's cable provider to log into HBO NOW" with
"using my company's Zoom subscription for my social hangout." I "went" to a
birthday party on Friday hosted on a `spotify.zoom.us` URL, and hosted a family
game night on `everbody.zoom.us` ðŸ˜›

Well, I bit the bullet. Using [Amado's soaring profits][21], I bought a month of
Good Zoom, so I'll be hosting Zoom hangouts that will probably be Jackbox TV
games for anyone who calls in. I've also been reading up on [Suz Hinton's
excellent documentation on her Twitch coding stream][22] and will look into
making that a thing I can do for anyone who wants to jump in. I'll probably
live-code some OCaml (work on [Fleaswallow][26]'s cache, or code organization, or
adding some tests lol) or [Amado ðŸ’Œ][27] (Elixir Phoenix app).

Literally anyone reading this: drop me a line if you'd like an invite to the
Zoom calls ðŸ˜„

### Twitch, streaming

While I'm trying to be a good digital granola muncher with the tools I use and
stay away from the Internet ClearChannel (e.g. moving from GMail, GitHub) it's
hard to think of leaving Twitch for streaming. I bought `tweetch.tv` and
`tootch.tv` in the far-off hopes of building a federated alternative (e.g.
[PeerTube][23] or [Mastodon][24]) because I think there's a lot of cool tech
there: besides federation and ActivityPub, PeerTube gets around bandwidth issues
by using a variation of the BitTorrent protocol, so popular videos don't crash a
server. Additionally, I think this kind of app with realtime chat is something
Phoenix would do well (the [Programming Pheonix book][25] uses a Twitch clone as
its example app lol).

But, well, time! Energy! Dedication! Will to live! All hard to get sometimes.
And most "power users" of streaming production really need that ad revenue; who,
on this entire Earth, will forgo it and is also someone anybody really likes to
watch (and have the expertise/interest to host a complex web app)?

Incidentally, that Facebook hasn't won this game handily is also the clearest
example that they're well into the "can't ship a good product anymore" phase of
monopoly (Google has been there since, idk, 2011?). Twitch works well enough for
top streamers, but the base of the pyramidâ€”people like me, and hundreds of
thousands of othersâ€”struggle to make it clear _to people who want to watch us_
when we're live. When I was still on Facebook I streamed _Celeste_ and had
arguably my best stream ever: several friends came in and cheered me on, a few
went on to buy the game. Because Facebook has exactly what other streamers would
want: an audience of their closest friends who are already dicking around
online.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Made a red lentil soup that was, frankly, a little disappointing. Needs a lot of hot sauce.</p>

### Fire Emblem thoughts

I'm a little further along in Fire Emblem, and I'm going to compare it to _XCOM_
(first and second, neither with any expansions) and _Final Fantasy Tactics: War
of the Lions_. This is going to be nerdy unless you've played these or similar
games.

**It's not as hard as I hoped.** Coming into this, I heard _Fire Emblem_, like
XCOM (or FFT if you don't revive in the following 3 turns) made losses
permanent; _Three Houses_ makes this an opt-in game mode, and I thought I was
doing something risky selecting into it. But, likeâ€¦ in the first 3 battles, I
had some close calls. After that? I suspect I'm maximizing my "non-battle
time" more than the devs intended, because I'm just walking up and clubbing
everyone to death. On top of that: there's a mechanic where you can wind back
the clock an arbitrary distance up to _n_ times if you truly fuck up (I'm
aboutâ€¦ halfway through the game, and I'm allowed to do this 10 times in a
battle?! Like, what are consequences?!).

Difficulty in a game is really, really hard to get right (I go into this a bit
on [my post on _Blasphemous_][3]). I recognize the stakes to deliver a winner for
AAA games is so high that most studios err on the side of making it easier than
threaten to really punish you. And sometimes, occasionally, I have to think in
a battle and it's fun again. But less than I thought or hoped! I was looking
forward to a game where I form attachments to characters and have to make hard
choices, or watch one of a few of them die, maybe. I doubt I'll have to unless I
hobble myself.

**The out-of-battle game is pretty fun so far, a little less my bag than XCOM
but more than FFT.** The struggle a lot of these games have is to give you
out-of-battle activity that doesn't feel like busywork for its own sake.

The class/advancement structure of FFT (while rather opaque in a blind, casual
playthrough) was fun for its discoverability, but the only thing you did outside
of battle was menu around, moving items between you party members, selling,
crafting, etc. XCOM has the whole ship-building component, research/engineering,
side quests, and managing the "state of invasion," which I found as interesting
as a second strategy game (with real stakes! you could _lose at XCOM_ because of
what went wrong out-of-battle!) than "what knobs does the game give me to make
my party members sharper along this-or-that axis?"

Like I said [in a previous post:][2] Fire Emblem feels a bit like a dating sim.
Almost everyone you can talk to (and there are several dozen of them) each has a
relationship tracker (with you _and_ each other) and personality traits to
fiddle those knobs. There's a famous idea of the human mind (usually) [only
being able to store seven, plus or minus two, things at a time][1], and this
game's out-of-battle mechanics really pushes that.

**The plot moves slowly, makes little sense, and is delightful fun.** You'll
spend a lot of time puttering around the academy doing minor missions with
definite handsome/beautiful Good Guys and evil-coded Bad Guys. I say it's a
dating sim, but the existence of hundreds of "support scenes" mean you're also
being convinced to watch an anime epic. I'm about 30 hours in and things just
Got Real, which was a relief.

Because of the first two points (difficulty, middling out-of-combat game), I
can't say this game _must be played:_ if you really want a fun tactical game,
download a GBA emulator (I went to college with the core dev of [mGBA][4], who
wrote [this amazing post,][5] so I'd suggest that one!) and play _Advance Wars,_
or any of the other games I mentioned here (I think _War of the Lions_ is better
at GoT-like High Political Fantasy). But the last point (on plot, and
"watching a fun anime"), as well as witnessing the sheer amount of production
value, it's a great distraction while the world is on fire. I'm already looking
forward to what I'll do differently in a second play-through.

**Extremely nerdy details for folks who've played before:**

- I selected the Black Eagles, because Woman With An Axe, and I liked the crew a
  little more.
- I'm in Part 2 now. I witnessed a coronation and am working for progressive
  revolution.
- Lindhardt is my boy; he seems to be correctly aloof about a lot of things. I'm
  leveling him as a Bishop (and eventually a Gremory) but his low speed gives
  him less action in fights, so he levels up too slowly.
- Got a crush on Petra. Foreigner underdog narratives for the win.
- The game is trying so hard to set me up with Bernadette, and she's legit one
  of my best characters in battleâ€”she's a sniper and whips ass on the
  battlefieldâ€”but the panic at literally _everything_ make her support scenes
  the hardest to watch.
- He's not in my house, but I want to recruit Rafael. I want the meaty man who
  looks like he hugs well.
- Ferdinand is the character I was trying to make with [Gorlif][28].
