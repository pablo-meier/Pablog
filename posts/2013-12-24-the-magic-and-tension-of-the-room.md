[_The Room_][1] is one of the most entertaining and engrossing movies I've seen
in my entire life. There's really nothing like it, and I find it both beautiful
and a bit bit tragic that I'm unlikely that to ever produce anything as engaging
as it.

I just finished [_The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room_][2] and thought
I'd write up a few thoughts I have.

<h3 id="what-is-the-room">What is _The Room_?</h3>

Succinctly, it's a [fractally terrible][3] piece of art. There are no redeeming
features in terms of craft -- the plot is inconsistent and hackneyed, the dialogue
and characters speaking it are inhuman, the design elements (set, costumes, sound
design) are divorced from any reality you've ever lived in.

And yet, unlike most other "bad movie" cult favorites (e.g. [_Troll 2_][5], or
[_Silent Night Deadly Night 2_][4]), _The Room_ has an odd feeling of integrity.
Behind the gloriously awful production, you see glimmers of the entire cast struggling
to make this work. The script is genuinely trying to tell a story, and watching it
ineptly fail is like watching a baby flamingo walking for the first time: inevitable
failure, and hilarious.  Given that the movie aims to be a humanity-affirming
successor to Tennessee Williams, it strange that its failure produces a human element
that so many better movies lack.

It doesn't suffice to say it's "the best bad movie ever." You really can't be
told how it manages to be engrossing and terrible, you just need to see it, and
yesterday. [The Onion AV Club][6] and [Entertainment Weekly][7] do a great job
covering its magic. And do checkout [the soundboard][8] for some more fun after
watching.

<h3 id="the-bell-curve-theory-of-bad-art">The Bell Curve theory of bad art</h3>

I have a way of convincing myself to enjoy a piece of art once it's clear that
it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. I think of a normalized bell curve:

<img src="/img/2013/12/bellcurve.png" alt="Image of a bell curve" />

Most art will be about average -- that's the fat part of the curve. There is
nothing remarkable about this; consume it and move on. But at the way right of
the curve are masterpieces: those pieces that inspire you, the life-changers.
There are only a few of these.

Once you realize you're watching something like _The Room_, something
uniquely poorly-done, look at the way left part of the bell curve and remember
that _they are just as rare and hard to find as the masterpieces._ Anybody can
suck: it takes something special to _suck just that much._ And better yet, the
ones at the bottom 5% were trying to be the top 5%! The masterpieces aimed high
and got high - the losers aimed high (or at least level) and went marvelously in
the wrong direction. It's like trying to build a rocket and instead making an
exceptional drill.

I find that most things I don't enjoy aren't even that bad -- they're just
unremarkable (Tevis Thompson touches on a similar notion -- though he seems to
find the boring actually _bad_ -- in [his excellent piece on videogame reviews
and the failures of _BioShock: Infinite_][9]). Paraphrasing, Sestero and Bissell
mention about Sestero's first meeting Tommy in an acting class in San Francisco:
"Yes he's the worst, but I have to do a scene with him, since he's the only person
in this class whose scenes I look forward to watching."

Whether in _The Room_ or anything else, remember the bell curve. Ask yourself
"if I tried to make something this bad, could I?" Because sometimes the answer
is a very shakey "no."

<h3 id="tension">Tension</h3>

I'd say the one thing that most surprises people watching _The Room_, no matter
how they're prepped, is the sheer number of questions you're left with. _How the
hell did that line get spoken, let alone written? Who decided spoons in picture
frames were acceptable set pieces?! HOW IS THIS SEX SCENE SO LONG?!?_

No joke, I showed it to someone last week and they grabbed me by the my
lapel-less shirt, shaking me: "I Just. Don't. Understand, Pablo. I Just.
Don't. Understand. How! How! How!"

These are fueled by the same thing that makes it so amazing to watch, and it's
also why, after 7 viewings, I'm beginning to feel some tension in enjoying the
movie as much as I do. Because there's a very simple answer to why the movie is
so gloriously incoherent:

_Tommy Wiseau is "not all there," mentally._

And if you accept this as a reason for _The Room_ to be what it is, well... we're
all collectively laughing at a guy who's trying to tell us something, play the game
of life with us, and is literally incapable at it.

<h3 id="brains-and-my-family-my-family-and-brains">Brains and my family, my family and brains</h3>

I've mentioned before that [my sister has spent much of the last 5 years recovering 
from a brain injury.][10]. When she first woke up from her coma, 3 months after
collapsing, she was unable to speak, walk, or feed herself. Over the next 4
months of rehab, day by day, she learned to do those things. Her memory grew from
remembering virtually nothing ("how old am I?"..."18"..."how old am I?") to
about 7 seconds, to a few minutes, to, after a few months, the span of a few
hours.

The process was grueling, and the most terrifying part was the knowledge that
_this could be it_ at any given time. There was no guarantee that Annalisa would
continue to heal and become an independent member of society. Annalisa's therapy
usually included group sessions with people who'd been there for years. There
were some who got kicked from therapy because it was clear their accidents and
traumas left them in a state that they'd never be independent members of
society.

Annalisa has healed, thankfully. There are still artifacts of the illness and
ways in which it affects her, but she's succeeding at her Master's program at
Columbia and in life such that I don't worry any more than any other 22 year-old
sister I could be so lucky to have, trying to make her way.

But you don't lose the memory, and so many of Tommy's creative choices and the
anecdotes provided in _The Disaster Artist_ really support the idea that his
brain is working differently than ours:

* Most obviously, thinking _The Room_ is good, let alone presentable. But this
  could also be attributed to vanity -- almost everybody thinks their work is great,
  that their kid was best in the school play, &c.
* His very simple narratives about the world: i.e. women are gossippy, love shopping,
  vain, manipulative, and are a people who need to be "gotten," unlike men, who
  are obvious and the default (_The Room_ contains so many lines of guys saying
  variations of "I don't get women, man").
* The only character whose profession is named is Peter, the psychologist. Most
  other characters are generally "busy," Lisa names "clients," and Johnny works
  at a bank _and_ at the computer industry with confidential clients, but only
  Peter has a named job, and it's one that someone who is working up from a
  brain injury would be very familiar with.
* Sestero & Bissell note that Tommy takes medications, in passing (cast members
  thought he was on drugs).
* Difficulty keeping continuous narrative threads in his mind. Barring the
  simplicity, Sestero & Bissell describe a scene that begins with Lisa and
  Claudette talking on the phone, and ends with Lisa walking Claudette to the
  door. Never mind moments that never go anywhere, like Chris-R/drugs,
  Claudette/Breast Cancer, Mark shaving, tuxedos, and alley football.
* Near obsession and/or single-mindedness on a topic that's interesting to him.
  In _The Disaster Artist_, there's a scene where it's implied Tommy watches
  Greg's film reel after filming [Retro Puppet Master][11] for many hours. Then,
  to get his SAG card, Tommy films a commercial modeled after his favorite part
  of the reel. That, and the fact that Tommy breaks into Greg's mail to see his
  first big acting paycheck.
