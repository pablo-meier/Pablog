Shit sucks and I'm protesting. But here's a post I drafted last week, on
games I've been playing recently.

### Overcooked 2

[Official Site][3].

This game‚Ä¶ can't be explained. I mean, I can try:

Do you like _tasks, for no reason_? Do you like doing them with other
people, under pressure? Oddly, it works! It's a game where you and others are
playing as chefs having to cook on a clock, and the mechanics only makes sense
when you play it with friends. It's "Dependency Graphs: The Game," and Saurya
tried to get Karen and I to play it and I **hated** it.

Then our California friends were playing it, and after a few hours, Karen and I
hit a rhythm where I could tolerate it. After a few more hours of that,
it's been fun ever since. Like partner dancing, it's a great way to mind-meld
with someone; the art is adorable and the kitchen designs are maddening,
creative, and fun. We bought all the DLCs, and playing a few levels has been a
great way to wind down an evening.

That said‚Ä¶ it's not relaxing! Make sure you and your friends are ready for it!
I laughed [when I saw this article:][1]

Also, some videos suggest [it's very possible to mod Unity games][4] with the
skills that I have, I thought it might be fun to make a "vegan recipes" mod,
though that would require custom 3D assets, which, is way out of my league
lol.

### Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark

[Official Site][5].

I think I got this from an Indie Bundle? Anyway, it is to _Final Fantasy
Tactics_ what [_TimeSpinner_ was to _Castlevania: SOTN_][9]: a fat, sloppy kiss
of a tribute with its own little spins. Like FFT, you'll spend 90% of the game
in menus, though unlike FFT, some non-game elements (the music, the story)
aren't _quite_ so compelling as what it's cribbing, IMO. Some of the art is
beautiful, however.

It's also extremely tweakable on difficulty, so you can make it a cakewalk or
go full XCOM. I played the first 4-5 hours and enjoyed it well enough, but don't
know if I'll continue; even though I can tweak it to make it easier, I used what
I thought "default settings" should be and am now stuck in a place where I have
to grind lol.

It's also made by what looks to be a married couple, which, like ["Ilona
Andrews"][6], is the dream: make fun creative things with the person you love.
I'm sure making the sausage is messier in practice, but still, you love to see
it.

### Return of the Obra Dinn

[Official Site][7].

Remember how [I said I _want_ to like Adventure Games,][2] but just can't seem to
make them stick? Yeah, that! This game is, frankly, a delightful piece of art,
_so well-executed_, and you feel like a genius when you "solve fates." But after
the first 10-20 I hit a few walls and felt fatigue. It's easy to cheat, but that
feels‚Ä¶ mean, especially since the game can really only be played once.

I also have this beef with inefficient interfaces, and the main puzzle-solving
mechanic (going into flashbacks) has just enough busywork and transition screens
to make it feel like a bit of a chore. Have a notebook handy. I imagine this is
more fun for experienced players of the genre; much like ultra-hard platformers
or roguelikes have an audience who loves them that isn't "most people,"
completing this with no hints feels a bit like the Adventure Game version of
that.

### A Case of Distrust

[Official Site][8].

On the opposite side of the table, I loved this game, and it only took me 2
hours to cut through. Maybe use it for a "date night" with some wine or
something, or play it alone like I did. It's also an "Adventure Game," but
IMO the puzzles are much more straightforward, and the writing is delightful
fun. I have the lightest of beefs with some of the character work, but there's
something very satisfying about a well-scoped work.

### On Adventure Games

I've linked his work before, but I sincerely do like it: Ian Danskin did a great
video ostensibly about Adventure Games, but about video games and genre more
generally, that I found very instructive. I feel like just playing/watching all
the cited media would be a hell of a fun way to spend a few months.

He did another, shorter video about two specific adventure games that, as
before, make me wish I liked adventure games more than I did lol

These are a fun use of a lunch break.
