I love [Andrew Sullivan's blog][1].  It offers excellent analysis containing
many sides of the news; what separates it from other blog is the conversations
he mediates with the readers.

One topic of great discussion is divinity: Sullivan himself is a Catholic (an
exemplary one, I would say, of the compassion and humility the faith claims to
provide) and he frequently discusses religion and the many conversations
around it.

He recently posted [a letter from an atheist reader][2] that echoes how I feel
about (what is being branded as) the New Atheists: yes they are loud, and
their tone does little to persuade believers in an honest debate.

But their contributions to the atheist community isn't persuasion of
believers, it's more a declaration of the right to exist, and a place in the
discussion. Like the earliest gay pride parades, they are there to say _"We're
here, our lack of belief is legitimate, and we won't be bullied out. We won't
settle for less respect. Get used to us."_

It was their voices, their arguments, and their courage that allowed me to
come out to the world as an atheist.

An excellent, excellent debate between Andrew Sullivan and Sam Harris, a
prolific atheist, is [over at Belief Net.][3]
