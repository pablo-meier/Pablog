At the [suggestions of some friends][2], I watch [_Barry_][3] and it feels like
a show made perfectly for me.

I won't sell the show as perfect; every show has to make choices about how much
disbelief they need you to suspend to tell their story in the style they'd like,
and _Barry_ might ask you to make a few leaps too large. It's also got one
female lead and almost exclusively White leads; these usually aren't the
ingredients of something I love this much.

It scratches a lot of my itches, and speaks to a Pablo that few people
in my current life knew or ever got to see. It speaks to a million little
narratives about being a person who finds refuge and growth in theater. It
generates fantastic comedy out of the horrifying search for purpose. It's Henry
Winkler giving the defining performance of his very storied career. There's
never a wasted scene.

### Men who are relatable, and when it's a problem

I watched _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ last year and while it held
up, there was a charming, anachronistic 2004-ness to it: CRT monitors,
cordless telephones, Clementine working at a Borders. Especially: Joel (Jim
Carrey's character) was a _misunderstood, quiet and sensitive brooding man_, the
kind that other _misunderstood, quiet and sensitive brooding men_ would see
themselves in. While _Garden State_ is credited for the quintissential Manic
Pixie Dream Girl, Zach Braff's character also gave us a shining example of this
other early-aughts trend: of men who are _too sensitive and intelligent_ to give
back to whatever environment they're in, which I don't think aged particularly
well.

Tons of stories are centered on dudes you're not supposed to like, but a
huge part of the audience misses the memo and lionizes them anyway: _Fight Club_
and _The Wolf of Wall Street_ are major examples, where they're showing you a
horrible caricature of someone and a bunch of dudes think "man, that guy's a
badass and I want that." _500 Days of Summer_ and _Breaking Bad_ had this, too;
_Rick and Morty_'s fanbase is famous for its dudes who relate to being Rick when
they're actually Jerry.

I bring all this up to say that I heavily distrust plots centered around
Tortured Flawed Men Who Do Horrible Things But Are Secretly Nice? Women don't
really get to be flawed; being an unlikable woman is a show-killer (name a hit
show with a woman anti-hero). I'm not sure if Barry, the character, will hold
up, or even if I want him to. Especially after Season 2, where they really look
at questions of "can a person change?" and "what does it take to properly
account for your past?", there's a part of me that thinks we can't just let
characters get away with shit just because we're steered into liking them.

And what characters! I _so badly_ want Noho Hank to be in my life, all the time.
Gene Cousineau is both an attentive, self-aware, motivating down-to-earth
theater teacher who fills his students with purpose and understands his role as
offering a form of therapy _while also_ being the quintissential theater grifter
taking advantage of (and looking down on) his clueless, hopeless students. I
lost my shit when I saw the book he peddles to them is called _Hit Your Mark and
Say Your Lines._

### Theater

</a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I still get
to fun an games. This was for a party, an "Intergalactic Peace Summit," where I
was the interpreter for the diplomat in my hands. I wrote up an instruction
manual <a href="https://github.com/pablo-meier/protocol-bot-manual/blob/master/protocol_bot_instruction_manual.pdf">here.</a></p>
</div>

I read Bissel van der Kolk's (who, oof, [watch out][1]) _The Body Keeps the
Score_ last year, which I found a pretty useful resource for thinking about
trauma and how we can treat it. I was initially surprised to see one of the
later chapters was about the therapeutic use of theater. It makes perfect
sense, and _Barry_ captures this: theater is an incredibly effective way to
find a community, to focus on yourself and your emotions, and to "try on"
different personalities and affectations. Scene study gives you a framework for
understanding how people communicate with each other, where we "leak" signal
about who we are and what we value, and how to think about motivations and form
actions around it. The work I did in theater for 7-8 years of Middle School/High
School/college was central to how I organize my thoughts and interpret the
world.

Like watching a child learn the alphabet can remind you of that slice of
time before you had all of written language available to you, so much about the
acting class in _Barry_ reminds me of a reality that was absolutely mine
(the sense of community, the purpose), while also being one I narrowly avoided
(the uncertainty of doing it "for real" in a capitalist society). Everyone
being polite with industry contacts while also insecure in their talents and
potentionally on the brink of financial ruin. Being told that you're at the top
of your craft in a scene where you've thoroughly psychologically tortured
yourself. The jealousy (Sally's monologue helping Barry run lines for his
feature audition in S2 _speaks to me, man_). It's particularly fun to see
excellent actors perform being beginning actors.

I have mostly negative feelings about nostalgia. Not that I don't feel it, or
even that I find it unpleasant, just: I feel like celebrating the decade when
you were a teenager and insisting it was a particularly special time in history
is really unself-aware: it wasn't globally special, it just mattered a
lot to you. And that's fine! Enjoy it! But challenge yourself to find that
meaning, today. Put yourself in the head of a teenager learning about the world
today, and listen to the pop the kids are making.

With that saidâ€¦ I miss theater. And I miss loving it, knowing I was good at it,
feeling committed to a purpose that way. Feeling like I was surrounded by peers
and we'd make a dent in the world with it. I'm unclear if the soil of my life
after my early 20's has produced a beanstalk that climbed that high; I think
I'm good enough at computers, but I haven't located the feeling of greater
purpose of community, just really fun ways of thinking.

---

I don't know if you'll enjoy this as much as I did; I'm also _sure_ other people
who are or were in theater will disagree strongly with me on what show biz is
really like, or its representation in _Barry._ But consider giving it a look! I
found myself forgetting to breathe at times.
