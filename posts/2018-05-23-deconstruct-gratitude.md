I'm about to leave Seattle after [Deconstruct][1]. I've [written before about why
I was a fan][2] going into it, and I hope to write a more thorough follow-up
after, but immediate thanks are in order:

To Gary and Brent, for organizing a conference with an aspirational degree of
care and foresight. This was one of the most affirming few days I've had in the
last decade and the conditions to enable this were created by deliberate
decisions and excellent execution. We should all be so lucky to have an
experience like this!

To Aaron, Allison, Anjana, Elle, Julia, Jumana, Katrina, Nabil, Nathaniel, Ryan,
Sandy, Stuart, Tea, Tom7, and Vicky for being such a warm, supportive, brilliant
group of people to share the stage with, from whom I'm learning so much 😄

To Karen, for her critically important feedback in the process, and support for
all things that make a Pablo bloom.

To the attendees; chatting with this crowd was honestly one of the times I felt
most at-home with a community of people in computing. Hallway chats were a joy.

To [Fred Hebert][3] for some of my favorite writing and learning materials that
got me on the path to my topic.

There are names I'm missing, but this is a start!
