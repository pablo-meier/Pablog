    og_description: Boy bands, pop culture, guys who went to Brown, a diary entry from when I was 12.

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ro0FW9Qt-4">Say You'll Be There</a>, by the Spice Girls.</em> üéµ</small>

This was getting pretty popular on my feeds:

A few reactions!

**Man, these guys are going to be doing this until they're old men.** Like [that
guy we keep making jump naked into a swimming pool.][8] Not complaining! Just
wonder how its gotta be lol.

**We were a Backstreet Boys household.** Annalisa is 4 years younger than me, so
we had the prime demographic during boy band fever. I was starting to
grow armpit hair, mystified by this concept of "cool," and had just emerged from
what many therapists consider the event that most broke me away for good from
the world of the Easily Happy And Socializes Well, so I was in _no_ mood for
sincere fandom of anything.

‚Ä¶but, I'm a performer and a queen at heart, so of course I loved pop music.
Here's a picture of my diary from just before I turn 13:

<a href="/img/2020/3/diary_entry.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/3/diary_entry_THUMB.jpg" alt="An old diary entry saying &quot;Well, I'm not so bummed out anymore. Sure, my parents are still blowing lots of $, but now we are at Rehoboth Beach, where arcades rule the land (heh heh heh!). I can't wait to hit the waves! Oh yeah, though they're not my favorite band, I scored Backstreet Boys tickets. While I try to hide it, I do like them and believe they're very talented. I can't wait to break the news to my sis on her birthday. Well, I'm also psyched about my b-day, In the world, the big thing is Pokemon. I like it a lot myself, but I'm not as dedicated‚Ä¶&quot;" style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Quarantine means oversharing, folks! Also, I didn't score those tickets, my parents did for Annalisa, and IIRC she took a friend with them? She said it was great. Also, on the next page, I drew my favorite Pokemon Abra, which you can see bleeding through.</p>

I never verbalized anything remotely like that, I was a year or two away from
being a horny gamer listening to White Suburban Kid rock like Sublime, Limp
Bizkit, and Kid Rock. The White suburbs "counterculture"‚Ä¶ it's Bad!

But as _Coco_ and _Gentefied_ and literally all <del>pandering</del>
Latino-targeting media will have a character say at some point: "Family comes
first." So my nascent depression and angst was _not_ going to keep me from being
a good older brother to my sister. I've seen _Spice World_ over a dozen times
(she would ritually put it on after school for a few months. Mel C
forever). I've seen _Billboard Dad_ and instinctively don't trust British people
named Nigel. Her favorite BSB member was Brian, which I thought was a little
refined, not going for the Nick train (no hate to Nick fans). Mine was Kevin,
because I thought cool guys had facial hair and dark hair.

Listening to the music years later, I think N'SYNC's pop holds up better. I
think it's generally more kinetic; even BSB's dance tunes (Everybody, Larger
Than Life) don't _bounce_ as much as _Bye Bye Bye_ or _Tearin' Up My Heart_.

**Pop culture is a meat grinder for its performers and it's weird and barbaric
that awareness of this doesn't change anything.** Screech, Britney (came away
super awesome and well-adjusted considering, but is locked up!!), Michael
Jackson, Aaron Carter. Like, man, how awful is it that I'm watching that video
glad they're all doing okay? I know AJ had substance issues, and there's
probably lots more I don't know. Fuck Lou Pearlman and the people who exploit
talented kids.

**Anyone remember the Boy Band zombie western?**

My favorite BSB song is probably _Everybody (Backstreet's Back)_, which also has [a
delightful video][9], and is always a hit at karaoke for a shy group.

### Online video

Via [Waxy.org][2], Andy Baio calls this video "John Krasinski doing his best Ze
Frank, way better than I expected it to be":

A few reactions!

Both Ze Frank and John Krasinski are both Brown alums! Go Bears! üêª

As much as I have college pride (in that I don't, really! Fuck Brown! You'll never get
another cent from me!), I can't fully disengage from the things that made me
happy to go, which is the kind of things you see in these two: Ze Frank has been
making awesome media for over a decade but got his BS in Neuroscience; John
Krasinski is _exactly_ the nerdy type of Brown literary type to adapt, produce,
direct, and star in [an artsy set of skits based on David Foster Wallace
essays.][3]

Also, John Krasinski was [strong in the running to be Captain America][6] before
Marvel decided to re-use [the Human Torch][7]. I wonder how different _that_
timeline would have looked for Marvel and John's career.

Ze Frank did ["the show"][4], which I was lucky enough to see when it was
happening live, when I was living in Brown's dorms. The biggest thing from that
was probably [the "Earth sandwich" sketch,][5] which has been copied several
times.

Anyway, I didn't care so much for this Good News thing (I suspect I would have
liked it more if I saw The Office), but you might like it. Was just reacting to
Andy's one-liner with weird facts.
