    og_description: I saw a huge, comprehensive list of online tools, here are a few others.

I saw [this list of tools for game makers][1] in my RSS feed today, and a) wow!,
b) it got me thinking of "lists of tools," and how much you're able to achieve
with a bit of scrappiness.

One person I've followed for years is [Peteris Krumins][2], who made and runs
[Browserling][3]. Peteris has a delightful online presence: he often makes
comics ([some here][4], [main site][5]), and made this one as a bit of a tribute
to the "more shell less egg" narrative, which is _just_ my kind of nerdy ([the
story][6], [some more analysis][7]):

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="https://comic.browserling.com/97" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/3/knuth-vs-mcilroy.png" alt="A cartoon-ified Knuth vs. McElroy with &quot;WHO WILL WIN?!&quot;" style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">(<a href="https://comic.browserling.com/97">via</a>)</p>
</div>

My favorite thing, of course, is that he still has this graphic on his site:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/jelly_stains.png" alt="old-fashioned type that says &quot;This space reserved for JELLY STAINS!&quot;" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

(it's a reference to [_The Little Schemer_][8], a book I loved)

Anyway, tools! He's done a cool thing of building/hosting a shit ton of
single-use browser-based tools. Here's [Online CSV tools][9], [Online Text
tools][10], and [online Random tools][11]. There areâ€¦ many!

Another person I've followed and linked is [Evan Miller][13], who wrote [Mac
desktop software for statistics use][12]. He's blogged some great things on
stats, programming languages, and software generally, but also hosts some [great
online stats tools][14], like a Sample Size calculator, which I find useful when
talking about whether or not something is worth doing A/B tests for (it's
[frequently not unless you have lots of activity][20]).

Lastly, if you're exploring a new tech (I encourage you to try Erlang or
Elixir), you can usually find an "Awesome-tool" list on GitHub for it. Your
mileage may vary, and many of those lists aren't super well-updated, but it can
be a good start, especially if you have a specific need ("how do I write XLSX
files in Ruby?"). Here's [an awesome list of awesome lists.][16] And [another
one][15].

I've opened the following tools at least 30 times in the last year:

* [UUID Generator][17], usually when writing test cases for the various
  applications that use these as IDs.

* [Fantasy Name Generator][18], for [my tabletop games.][19]
