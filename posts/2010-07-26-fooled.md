Taken from [this post][1], this passage hit a bit close to home:

> Since TV was invented, critics have pointed out the dangers of watching the
> perfect people who seem to inhabit the screen. They are almost universally
> beautiful, live in interesting places, do interesting work (if they work at
> all), are unfailingly witty, and never have to do any cleaning. They never
> even need to use the toilet. It cannot be psychologically healthy to compare
> yourself to these phantasms.
>
> So itâ€™s interesting that social networks have inadvertently created the same
> effect, but using an even more powerful source. Instead of actors in
> Hollywood, the characters are people that you know to be real and have
> actually met. The editing is done not by film school graduates, but by the
> people themselves.

I confess: much of my Facebook/blogging/tweeting are the 'highlights,'
versions of myself that I'm most proud of (or least ashamed of). I don't write
about them often, but my life is plenty full of struggles, questions,
insecurities and obstacles. I used to blog about those things (though, as if
to foreshadow, I wrote very, very cryptically) over at [my old blog][2], which
I kept between freshman and sophomore year of college.

I don't think there's any shame, however, in just broadcasting your
highlights. People comb their hair and check their teeth before they go out;
they wear [Booty Pop][3] panties and overblow their resumes. We've always
advertised what we think is our best believable narrative, and when we get
hard pressed, we'll believe it, too.

In only slightly related news, see [a blog devoted to ugly animals][4]. Also,

Kind of reminds me of Charlie Chaplin [losing a Charlie Chaplin lookalike
contest.][5]
