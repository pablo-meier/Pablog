As a listener and [Patron][1] of the podcast [Flash Forward][2] (you should
listen! it's a _fantastic show!_) I'm part of its nascent book club, our first
book was [The City in the Middle of the Night][3], by Charlie Jane Anders. I
really enjoyed this!

<!-- more -->

If you enjoy far-off sci-fi, a lot of its elements are crafted with care.
When I play D&D I'm frequently sad that many adventuring scenarios (say, "tomb
of a lost civilization") are unlikely in the real world, at least in
the D&D sense ‚Äî the tombs we discover don't contain working traps, or an
ecosystem of guardian critters just milling about for thousands of years, or
that it contains an artifact which can regrow lost limbs. Often, the people who
built the tomb are from a civilization we've heard of and know a fair bit about,
and its contents are dusty and brittle.

I mention this because it's just as fun to wonder how _we, currently_ can become
a "lost civilization," and _City_ sets its story in a lovely, plausible such
way. There's a Goldilocks-level of distance between the reader and the novel's
setting, so you're often reading with a background process running of connecting
the two, and many clues (the names given to the planet's food and wildlife, the
brief mentions of what the characters learned in history class, descriptions of
the tech) mean you have something to chew on while the action is happening.

I sometimes remember this paragraph from [a reivew of Twilight by Paul
Constant][5] when I think of authors and what they're good at:

> But the truth of megapublishing is that mega-authors must only do one thing
> really well: Stephen King writes a disturbing scene more effectively than any
> other author; Dan Brown moves a plot forward with such velocity that readers
> don't have time to realize that nothing makes sense. What Meyer does, maybe
> better than anyone else in popular fiction right now, is capture that
> sensation of new teenage love, when one's genitals have just come alive and
> the desire to copulate is so powerful and all-consuming that the teenage
> brain, still reeling from the recent passage from childhood, has to interpret
> it as powerful, undying love‚Äîthe kind of love that nobody on earth has ever or
> will ever experience again.

I feel like the strength of _City_ comes from an a similarly-skilled
understanding of bonds, relationships, and trauma. If I was given this setting +
plot and had to write it out as a novel, nobody would come along with it or find
it enjoyable. I feel like Anders really taps into the feelings of love,
commitment, and motivations behind people in varying degrees of stress and
desperation. If you imagine relationship commentary as a Jenga tower, the
characters start with decent-but-believable baggage, and all the
sci-fi/adventure works to carefully whittle away at that tower so reading the
novel is progressively more impressive.  

If you're looking for your next fiction read, I'd recommend it üòÑ

## SPOILERS GOING FORWARD, YE BE WARNED

Here, I'll just fire away quick observations, devoid of context:

Compositionally, the ending felt a bit abrupt for me, as it happened on the cusp
of some great conflicts. This may be (hopefully!) setting it up for future
stories, but I was a little sad to reach it.

In the Acknowledgements, the author playfully mentions a reader who debated them
over one of the fictional constructs (Xiosphant having multiple types of
currency), and I feel like I'd play that role about some of the wildlife. A part
of my brain wondered how so many unbelievably threatening predators sustain
themselves in such a wasteland; predators tend to arise only when there's a lot
of prey available, and you never have too many.

Despite that nit, however, I **love** the "There Be Dragons Here, But Actually"
vibe of monsters and intercity travel.

The use of Earth animal names for these other creatures was endearing, a funny
and believable thing for humans to preserve. It also, like the [combined
animals][6] of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ (buzzard wasps!) added some levity.

Generally, all the naming was delightful ("swamp vodka," how many things were
made with moss, "food dollars" vs. "infrastructure chits," "cat butter") and
helped build this world that frankly sounds disgusting and charming, and is
believably normalized by its inhabitants.

I seem to hate Bianca a whole lot less than other reviewers seemed to. Like,
yes, she reminds me of a group of people who drive me absolutely crazy (a lot of
my margin notes are "WHITE GUILT" when she rationalizes). I didn't think my
job reading the book was to agree with or like her, I only required that she and
the people reacting to her be believable, which they creepily are.

I found the Citizens to be very intruiging ‚Äî I have a lot of jumbled thoughts
around interdependence as a concept (history of social collapse frequently names
it the most important cause; meanwhile, isolationist societies tend to fail too,
tend to suck, and are boring). There are a lot of very provocative lines about
the chosen life on the road ("a lot of what we call civilization is just
neglect"). One of the reasons I don't plan on going to Burning Man again was
because both trips contained and triggered some traumatic experiences I've had
with intentional, dependent communities, so this was almost therapeutic to work
through, especially since I'd already found Mouth to be such a delightful
character.

[Another review][4] thinks this entire book is about societies and ideology:

> In every book, there is a moment. A point at which the writer must lay out, in
> plain terms, their central argument. It doesn't matter where it happens, only
> that it does. [‚Ä¶] Everything before it will be prologue. Everything after,
> the result.
>
> [‚Ä¶] Charlie Jane Anders places her argument on page 212, halfway down the
> page, in the middle of a moment of tumult, in the process of meeting a new
> character. "Grand social ideas‚Ä¶ break if you put too much weight on them."
> 
> That's the book. All of it. Twelve words.

I‚Ä¶ don't buy this at all. The Citizens' downfall doesn't at all come from
"putting too much weight" on their ideas, ditto the Gelet. Even Xiosphant and
Argelo don't really "collapse" because too much weight goes into their
differences ‚Äî they'd probably be relatively stable if the planet weren't _so_
hostile. Suboptimal, sure, but part-in-parcel with human societies, at least as
we've observed them.
