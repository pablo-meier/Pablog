I used to blog about [fun things I loved][4], so here's one I've been enjoying
recently: [Animal Crossing: New Leaf.][9]

<h3 id="what-i-love-about-it">What I love about it</h3>

For those who don't know, _Animal Crossing_ has you move a character into a
town of cute animals. From there you can do an assortment of things: talk to the
animals in town, write letters to other residents, purchase furniture for your
house, go fishing, plant trees, chop trees… all to no defined end. The town
has a flag you design, everyone greets you with a jingle you compose.

The town exists in real-world time: when you play at 8:00 AM, it's morning,
and many of the shops haven't opened yet. If you play at 11:00 PM, some
villagers are out clubbing, and different fish are swimming in the river to
catch. When you play in December it snows. When add to your house the contractor
says "your new room will be done tomorrow!," they literally mean _tomorrow_, so
its time to turn off the game an enjoy your real life.

In an interview linked below, game maker [Daniel Cook][11] describes its appeal
with

>  we had a working group trying to understand the psychology 'comfy games' like
>  Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing. One thing we noticed is that many games
>  focus on the bottom portion of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. They deal with
>  survival, food, shelter and physical threats. Comfy games are instead
>  comfortable spaces where you can work on some higher level human needs. You can
>  dabble with self reflection, little social moments and maybe self expression.
>  Games that treat players like higher order humans instead of twitchy,
>  fear-based animals are a super cool thing!

And I think that's the best description. Also, its aesthetics are **adorable**.

A few words on what else I love about it:

<h4 id="better-gamification">Better "gamification"</h4>

Most software I'm using these days employ people whose entire job it is to
increase my engagement with their product. Each engagment is designed to be a
seed for future engagement: it's not enough that I'm using the product, I have
to be reminded that it offers SO MUCH MORE VALUE and it needs to be hard to
leave. See [this article on engagement hacks][5]. In theory these companies are
merely adding value to your life by making you more aware of their offerings; in
practice, they're just trying to squeeze more value from you so their bosses and
investors can make fortunes. 

The worst of this type is [dark patterns][6], where they give up the pretense of
even being valuable and just trick you into shit they can monetize.

It's a game played by rich people where you're the ball. _Animal Crossing_ feels
different: when you catch a fish, there's no Share button. There's no NOW CATCH
MORE FISH. Just… "hey, you caught a fish. Nice!" It's the anti-Zynga game: we
made a game, we hope you like it. It's not phoning home tracking your every
action. I don't think everyone will react this way, but I love a game that can
_never_ have Internet and still be its full self.

This isn't to say there aren't incentives to keep playing. One of the ways you
spot pellet dispensers in games is multiple currencies: you buy your gear with
Flobos, your food with Gizmos, and power-ups with Sheeshos. This game has Bells,
but it also has [MEOW Coupons][7], which you get for completing daily and weekly
initiatives. I've never felt it intrusive, nor do I let it impact how I play the
game, but it's the Diet RC Cola version of the same mechanic and it'd be remiss
not to mention it.

Overall, it's _peaceful_ to play, which isn't something I can say about almost
anything else I do.

<h4 id="relationship-hacks">Relationship hacks</h4>

The game is fine fun, but it's _really_ fun if you share a space with someone or
someones. I'm thinking of getting a 3DS and leaving a copy in my office for
coworkers so we can blow off steam between commits. I shared my first town 
(Risotto) in the original Gamecube _Animal Crossing_ and am sharing this _New
Leaf_ town with my current girlfriend, and it gives us a fun, low-pressure thing
to bond over. She wants to cut down some trees so I leave her axes. She knows I
love [Gyroids][8], so she leaves them for me.

<h3 id="what-could-be-better">What could be better</h3>

While not being Internet-connected is a core part of the charm, you can't help
but feel there's missed opportunities on visiting other towns, or sharing your
town with others. I'd love an easier way to share the little place we're
building with friends without them having to have 3DSes. I worry that everything
we're building is in one physical cart.

I'm glad design decisions opted towards offline rather than online content, but
I feel like Something Greater lies in the space between the online experiences
of this game and the Click Factories that Zynga got temporarily rich with.

<h3 id="not-pocket-camp">Not _Pocket Camp_</h3>

You may be tempted, as I was, to see if there's a version of the game you can
play on your phone. I have the [newest Layton game][10] on my phone and certainly
don't carry my 3DS around. You'll find _Pocket Camp._

I haven't played it, but there's [been][2] [writing][3] that it isn't congruent
with many ideals of the series: pressure to log in, microtransactions, a
non-transactional relationship to the other animals. My girlfriend downloaded it
and didn't feel compelled to keep playing it.

Besides, I like the form factor of not having it on my phone. The 3DS sits in
the apartment as the "Animal Crossing" machine we pass around and/or leave for
each other.

<h3 id="additional-reading">Additional Reading</h3>

- GamaSutra had [a great set of interviews with developers about _Pocket Camp_][1],
where I quoted Daniel Cook above. It also included this great line by Yoko Taro:

> I played the 3DS DobuMori (Animal Crossing), and you know the raccoon who
> makes you get a mortgage without agreeing to it? It was like the Lehman Shock
> (The Bankruptcy Of Lehman Brothers), so I wanted to get revenge on him in the
> mobile version.
>
> I was kind of sad because there are fewer things you can do in the mobile app,
> compared to the 3DS version. The fact that you have less freedom, makes the
> Ditch-Forest seem even darker.
> 
> Let's take, for example, what the "monsters" eat. The rabbit seems to be of the
> normal herbivorous variety, but can be seen, in this game, grilling and eating
> fish. Also, in this game, pigs and cows enjoy barbecue (but you can't see what
> they're grilling). What is going on in this ecosystem? When you run out of
> things to eat, do you resort to cannibalism? Is there so much difference in the
> intelligence of birds and fish? If you walk on two legs and talk, does that mean
> you won't be hunted? Is the value of your life determined by your intelligence?
> There are so many interesting themes hidden in this game.
> 
> Also, I want to say something about the unreasonable shopping. You need to
> predict what those monsters want like an esper (human who possesses ESP), and
> give those things to them to get your big reward. What is this a metaphor for?
> Why do you have to collect things that are right next to the monsters to make
> them happy, like a slave? I guess this represents the divisions between people
> in class society.
> 
> I haven't put any furniture or anything in my camp except a kerosene tank. I
> started this game to get revenge on that raccoon, Tanukichi, but now I have a
> different purpose.
> 
> I'll enjoy playing this game until I burn that dark forest down.

- People are making [little prisons and cults][12] in _Pocket Camp_.
