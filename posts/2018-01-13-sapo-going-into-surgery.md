The little broseph is going into surgery tomorrow morning. Here he is at the
vet's office:

**I'll start by saying it's a minor operation, on the order of getting a dog
spayed, so we expect a full recovery.**<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">1</a></sup>

On Tuesday night he vomited, was very low-energy, and shaked a fair bit. The
next day on his walk he had diarrhea. I kept waiting for something to "pass" (or
be vomited away) but he seemed largely unable to keep food down.

Still, his appetite and energy grew back to seemingly normal levels. By Thursday,
he was still vomiting, and the kibble looked largely intact.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">2</a></sup>
Doing [a bit of research][1], it looked like repeated vomiting could be the
result of some pretty scary stuff. One theory was blockage: that he'd eaten
something inedible that was preventing the kibble from entering the
intestines.

We scheduled a vet appointment, and tested this by feeding him chicken broth and
soft potatoes, both of which could "slide" past any blockage. He kept _that_
food down, and X-Rays at the vet confirmed he has something in his stomach.

Karen and I have **no** idea what the blockage can be: Sapo is pretty good at
not eating non-food, and the blockage was a perfectly round object, like a ball
(which we don't play with). We anticipate learning what happened after the
operation.

Big thanks to the very fine folks at [Heart of Chelsea Animal Hospital][3] for
yet another great care experience. They've been Sapo's vet since October 25,
2015, the day after I adopted him üôÇ And, of course, [Badass Brooklyn Animal
Rescue][4] for bringing us together.

If you want to know a bit about Dog Life, here's a detail: our other dog, Rocco,
would sometimes eat the vomit since the kibble was largely intact and
undigested. It made spotting the vomit harder because we'd come home from work
and smell it, but not see it. Dog ownership is glorious, you see.
