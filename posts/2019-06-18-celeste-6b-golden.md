    og_description: I recorded myself beat a hard level of Celeste with no deaths.

I'm [still playing Celeste][1], trying to get all the Golden Strawberries:
where you beat a level without ever dying. It's very hard! I don't know anyone
in my real life who's done it! I heard one friend of a friend did, though they
used Assist Mode, which I'm not.

It's been a slog, but I've collected most of them. I have three left. On Sunday
I recorded myself playing since I felt this last one was close, and I was right.
Here's me getting the Golden in 6b (Reflections), apologies for the low volume:

</video>

Notes: The screen at 4:26 did **not** go according to plan. And that last jump
at 6:34 was super, super close, not how I planned it, and would have ended me if
I wasn't so lucky 😛

I'll continue to say this: if you play games, I highly recommend giving
_Celeste_ a go. It's challenging, but it's also got [Assist Mode][2] to make it
as available as possible 😄
