    og_description: Description of my Fate character, √Ångel Salinas.

<small><em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffH_Mp74xh4">HATE</a>, by Charisma.com.</em></small>

To recap this recent set of tabletop gaming blog posts, I've been playing
_Dungeons & Dragons_ as [Homage][1], _Mouse Guard_ as [Gorlif][2], and I'm about
to enter a _Fate_ campaign and [wrote up some process sketches for that
character][3].

The feedback from the GM was that, while many of the sketches were a
lot of fun, we're really going for something a bit more realistic than a
battle cyborg, or someone with detacheable parts. We looked at _The Artiste_ and
considered someone who did trick shooting. I eventually ended up going with
the Mike Erhmantraut idea.

Meet √Ångel Salinas, cast as H√©ctor Elizondo in my head.

### Background

Born April 22, 1953, √Ångel was the son of a wicker furniture maker and his wife,
a homemaker, in El Crucero, Nicaragua. He has 3 brothers (2 older, Andr√©s and
Mateo, 1 younger, Francisco) and two sisters (both older, Ximena and Sara). When
he was 19 he married a younger woman, Concepci√≥n, and worked more-or-less
peaceably as a tailor for about 10 years, having 3 kids (Adelita, Esperanza, and
Osvaldo).

For most of the time, he ignored and didn't participate in the Nicaraguan
Revolution. He had a bit of an alcohol problem, and ran up some debt (mostly
gambling, but he was gambling to pay back a smaller amount of debt ‚Äî in
today's dollars, it'd be like running up $20k of gambling debts that started
when he was trying to win enough money to pay a $3.5k debt). Ostensibly to help
with the debt but just as much that he was getting a bit antsy with a life less
fulfilling than he was promised, he started working with the _Frente
Sandinista._ He'd help tailor disguises for their clandestine operations, he'd
add hidden pockets to clothes, use a code of seams and stitches to communicate
information, and offered reduced-price dry cleaning. They taught him to shoot,
which seemed more about forming bonds and brotherhood than fear that he'd
actually have to use it.

It turns out, he did. A petty government official asked him to deliver his
tailored clothes to an address which turned out to be abandoned.
When he arrived, there was a table, and it was clear he was going to be
interrogated. Knowing this was a risk and afraid of a snitch, he was followed by
some Sandinistas. The government official thought it was a setup, and "luckily"
brought a squad of his own. A firefight ensued, and √Ångel sat in the middle,
clutching the clothes and the pistol he carried. It was bloody, both sides at various times
fired at him thinking he was the cause of their current stress, and he fired
back at both sides in self-defense. Both sides had stragglers who left and told
whatever story they had in mind to their superiors. Worried that both sides would blame him, and
already in a lot of debt, he packed up his family that night and fled to Mexico.

On the way, he witnessed, held off, and fell prey to a number of robberies that
threatened his family and left an impression on him. Furthermore, he was
traumatized by the gunfight, and vowed to never allow himself to be that
vulnerable again. Getting to Mexico City, he applied to work in the police
force, starting with a beat cop on the Polic√≠a Sectoral, then getting promoted
to detective, where he spent most of his career.  He and his wife separated. His
children grew up and married. He re-married. He kept enough contact with his
siblings enough to know that Ximena married a military man in Nicaragua and that
she and her family disappeared after one of the purges. Mateo fell into a bad
drug habit and moved to another town in Nicaragua. He never heard what happened
to Andr√©s, Francisco, or Sara, though he imagines they had kids somewhere down
the line. His kids grew up and married, Osvaldo going to the United States, and
the other two living in Mexico City.

Twelve years after the gunfight in Nicaragua, he was approached by a young man
named Bruno, who claimed to be Sara's son. He said she died of tuberculosis
about 7 years after √Ångel left, and he'd also had to flee Nicaragua, and spent
most of his energies tracking down √Ångel. √Ångel was wary but trusting, and spent
the next few weeks applying some detective skills to verify the story. It didn't
check out: he deduced that Bruno was an imposter, paid on behalf of the son of a
gang leader he'd testified against as a detective, years ago. He surprised
Bruno, interrogated him, and learned of their revenge plot: his current and
former wife were just transported to a warehouse, and figures in Nicaragua were
on their way up to have their own machinations against him.

He also learned that "Bruno" was based on a real identity: Sara _really did_ have
a son named Bruno who's out there somewhere, and she really did die of
tuberculosis. He killed the imposter, went to the warehouse, and liberated his
former and current wife, leaving a number of dead bodies. He gave them each half
of his savings, told them to flee. One of his proteges from his police days
who'd made it to the _Agrupamiento Alfa_ told him he could get him in a safe
house in the USA. At 54, he fled again, this time to Billings, Montana.

He spent the first 4 years as a tailor at a Nordstrom, but wanted more _pista_
to live a little more comfortably, pay a Private Investigator to keep him
informed of his family business in both Mexico and Nicaragua, and support a few
other immigrant proteges he'd met, so he started doing some side hustles.
Things like protection jobs, investigative work, "fixer" at murder scenes,
arranging bribes, maybe a professional witness gig every here and there. He went
back to drinking. He developed a reputation.

### Additional Notes

**High Concept:** Grizzled, older former detective and tailor with baggage.
Thinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy

**Trouble:** Life seems to want to put me in crossfires.

**Aspects:**

* One good bullet, OR several clips. [No half-measures.][5]
* More tortoise, less hare: "I take my time, but I always win!" (quote stolen from [here][4])
* "No, really, [you'll thank me later][6] for minding the details."

**Skills:**

* Great (+4): Shoot
* Good (+3): Investigate, Contacts
* Fair (+2): Notice, Stealth, Will
* Average (+1): Rapport, Burglary, Empathy, Provoke

**Stunts (WIP):**

**Called Shot:** During a Shoot attack, spend a fate point and declare a
specific condition you want to inflict on a target, like Shot in the Hand. If
you succeed, you place that as a situation aspect on them in addition to hitting
them for stress.

**Lie Whisperer:** +2 to all Empathy rolls made to discern or discover lies,
whether they‚Äôre directed at you or someone else.

**One Person, Many Faces:** Whenever you meet someone new, you can spend a fate
point to declare that you‚Äôve met that person before, but under a different name
and identity. Create a situation aspect to represent your cover story, and you
can use Deceive in place of Rapport whenever interacting with that person.

**Face in the Crowd:** +2 to any Stealth roll to blend into a crowd. What a
‚Äúcrowd‚Äù means will depend on the environment‚Äîa subway station requires more
people to be crowded than a small bar.

### Playing √Ångel

While I don't know a whole lot about what it will be like to _play_ √Ångel, I do
like the opportunity to play a Latino and explore this part of my identity
through play. The "son of a wicker furniture maker" comes directly from my
great-grandfather, and many elements (the number of siblings, marrying early,
making a life in a country torn by Civil War mostly created by American
corporate interests) are in our history as well. There's a lot I don't know
about conflicts in Nicaragua (I'm a lot more versed in the Guatemalan Civil
War), and I enjoyed this research. I'm more motivated to research it a little
further.

I may elaborate in a further post, but one of my favorite things about tabletop
gaming is how much of a growth process it can even be to play: I mentioned that
Gorlif is something of an exercise in empathy, and √Ångel is looking to be a way
I can exercise and explore my Latino background. An excellent articulation of
this is in [this article by a trauma survivor][7] who uses gaming as a healing
tool, and this allows me to scratch some itches I don't normally scratch.
