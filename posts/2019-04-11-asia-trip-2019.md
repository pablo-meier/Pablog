    og_description: I spent two weeks traveling Asia, it was extremely gratifying.

<small>🎵 <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnMXoyUqzkw">Roar</a>, by Treat. I will buy a  🍺, no matter how challenging logistically, for anyone who can state why I chose this song for this post.</em> 🎵</small>

I just took a trip to Asia where I visited 4 countries. It's been a while since
I've done anything like this, and I had a great time!

I'll start with high-level feelings/observations, then go over the What in the
photos at the bottom of each section. You can skip to any of the legs with the

**📅 2019-03-18 → 2019-03-21**<br />
**Pablo, Karen, and Saurya**

</div>

The Big Reason for this trip, in my mind, was to visit my bestie
[Saurya][3]. We lived together in college and it's one of the most lasting and
fulfilling friendships I've ever had. While Karen and I made a bigger trip of
it, we started here because I missed my boy.

Control structures (like governments) are either top-down, mandating the shape
growth of their subjects (e.g. government comes up with a tree policy, then
plants or uproots trees to fit it) or they're bottom-up (government observes the
trees already in-place, and comes up with a tree policy based to suit that). It's
a bit like how Google used to map the Internet as an emergent phenomena, but now
the Internet shapes itself to please Google.

In this way, my main reaction to Singapore was observing it as one of the most
top-down states I've ever experienced. I saw exactly one dog and zero
panhandlers. Every public utility had clean bathrooms.  Exactly one person (a
barista) had any traditionally countercultural markings (colored hair and gauged
ear piercings). It's cleanliness made it look like a movie set for "modern city
in the 21st century," rather than what I know those cities to actually look
like. For almost everything I asked "why is it like this?", I could produce an
answer along "the government wanted it that way (probably to be friendly to
Western and Eastern businesses)".

(this could all be confirmation bias: besides its reputation, when our plane
landed they prime your reactions by reminding you that carrying illicit drugs
carries a mandatory death sentence)

All told, for a certain type of person: it works! If you have money and are
okay spending it, it looks like a fine place to be. I just feel funny when
things seem too orderly or clean.

Pros:

* Hawker centers are _amazing_ and I want to be near them all the time.

* The bird park is spectacular, in the truest meaning of "spectacle." Karen
  happens to love birds more than most but we had an amazing afternoon there.

* I enjoyed using [Go-Jek][4] to get around. They're 2nd to [Grab][5], making
  them "the Lyft of SEA." It's also founded by a Brown alum, which, considering
  [Uber's new CEO is also a Brown alum][6], makes us excellent at congesting
  cities.

It hurt my brain a bit to do too many price calculations: things were either
more expensive than I felt great paying (cocktails, fancy food, some attractions,
one of the hotels we stayed at) but others far less (non-fancy food, the other
hotel we stayed at, transporation costs).

<h2 id="bali">Bali (Indonesia — Kuta and Ubud) 🇮🇩</h2>

**📅 2019-03-21 → 2019-03-24**<br />
**Pablo and Karen**

Bali came next. While it's world-famous, we went in large part at the suggestion
of a friend of ours. A few life events were timed to hit Karen and I
around this time (notice that we're buying a house and Karen is changing jobs?);
our friend friend suggested "just take a break from working for 6 months and
live as expats in Bali." We didn't end up doing that, but we did visit on this
trip. Saurya didn't come with us, so this leg was Karen + Pablo.

Bali reminded me a lot of Guatemala: infrastructure on a comparable level, a 
healthy tourist economy, the dollar going pretty far, delicious climate, and
exceptionally friendly people. The food was obviously amazing, I feel this is in
part because its ingredients seem fresher; when you eat fruit in Guatemala it
often feels sweeter, and the flesh meatier. I'm no expert, and again,
this could be confirmation bias, but I had a similar experience here.

We spent our first night in Kuta, which is famous in part for its nightlife.
Trouble is, we were still jetlagged, and couldn't stay awake past 10:00PM. It was
a lovely day and a half, but I can't say we had the experience people suggested.
We went to Ubud next, where we'd spend the majority of our trip.

I had a lot of fun, but candidly, Bali was my least favorite leg in the
trip. Virtually all the Balinese people we saw or interacted with were in the service
of tourists like us. Many of the people we saw, total (40%? 50%?), were tourists
like us. This led to a dynamic where I didn't feel like we were visitors
observing communities of others living their lives, it felt more like there was
a buffet going on, and it was unclear if they had offered us a buffet of
simulacrum attractions/entertainment for us to sample, or if we were a dish in a
buffet of tourists for them to pluck at.

Everyone was friendly! But, every interaction was transactional! I felt a bit
like a money piñata, with most interactions trying to work me. To be clear: **I
had a great time.** And I absolutely don't judge countries for maximizing revenue
from tourists (_get that bread!_). I just don't feel like it gets me what I
want when I travel. I expect we'll go back some day, and I suspect we'll do a
bit more research to avoid the tourist loop we hit this time.

<p>This was cute. I read a lot of Uber's issues with internationalization with interest (apparently it's a lot like <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2017/5/30/15713060/mister-softee-new-york-ice-cream-turf-war">NYC's soft-serve turf wars</a>, settled with baseball bats). While I'm conflicted about ridesharing, I really missed Go-Jek in Ubud; there wasn't much sidewalk to walk long distances, and getting a cab was a miserable, price-gouging experience.</p>

<p>We went to a cultural dance presentation, which was great! That said, we were asked to be ready at 4:00 with a return time of 9:00, then spent most of that time being ferried around shops the operator had relationships with. The dance performance turned out to be 1 hour long.</p>

<h2 id="taiwan">Taiwan (Taipei) 🇹🇼</h2>

**📅 2019-03-25 → 2019-03-28**<br />
**Pablo and Saurya**

</div>

Karen went back to the States at this point, only taking a week off. Saurya's
spent a lot of his 4 years in Singapore traveling through Asia, but never
Taiwan, so we visited together. So this was Saurya + Pablo.

_I **loved** Taiwan._ It's hard to separate the city itself with having 4 days
of quality time with a best friend you haven't seen for years, especially
considering how well our travel styles meshed (e.g. I love to walk, we walked 16
miles on our first day). This nourished me in a way I deeply, deeply needed.

Taipei seemed like a "just right"-sized city: one thing I loved about SF was how
walkable it was, and Taipei was large enough to have a lot of everything without
being a metropolis that makes you feel insignificant. The weather was my
favorite of any of the cities I visited, _literally everything_ I ate there was
delicious and criminally affordable. I ate more dumplings in those four days
than I've eaten in the last 5 years **and I'M NOT DONE.**

Our days often involved going walking trail cultural attractions,
and our nights (thanks to a lack of open container laws) often looked like:

* Get a giant beer from 7-Eleven for USD $2.
* Look at the next great-looking thing from [this list][2] (dumplings or noodles or shaved ice or night markets or…)
* "That looks like it might be about a 40 minute walk?"
* Bare out our souls to each other over beer while walking.
* Many interruptions for yummy things we see along the way.

After Bali, the main change I observed was that Saurya and I were maybe half the
foreigners I saw for the entire trip. This gave exploration a very different
vibe: it felt more like we were in a living, breathing place independent from
our experiences, rather than having our foreigner experiences centered.

<p>One of Saurya's friends who moved to Taiwan from the US said he missed "a great donut every now and then." I <em>think</em> he meant he missed Dunkin specifically, since we took this as a challenge and found Taiwanese donuts and found them satisfactory. This was a red bean donut, I think.</p>

<h2 id="korea">Korea (Seoul) 🇰🇷</h2>

**📅 2019-03-28 → 2019-03-31**<br />
**… Pablo … alone …**

Korea blew me away. My biggest obstacle was that I didn't pack for cold. I
walked around in the hoodie I packed and slowly froze while exploreing the city.

(Karen, upon hearing this: "could you have bought a light coat, or heavier
sweater while you were there?" Dear reader, I never thought to do this. I can't
believe I'm allowed to drive)

Seoul is _massive_: I don't think the States has an equivalent city where we
just sprawled and sprawled while maintaining a coherent whole (it may just be my
bias for East Coast cities? Karen suggested LA, which seems correct. Seoul has
over twice as many people though). The city it reminded me most of was Guatemala
City, where we just kept expanding, and from the top of nearby volcanos you see
several "city centers" for each of its districts, rather than a single big
skyline.

Getting around reminded me most of my time in San Francisco: the bus + subway
system is robust, and the T-Card system (one payment card for all transport,
including taxis, readily available) made me pretty jealous. Broadly speaking, I
group cities into "comfortable to own a car, shitty to be a pedestrian" vs.
"comfortable to be a pedestrian, shitty to own a private car" and Seoul seemed
to strike the best middle ground I've seen, where roads were wide and plentiful,
while sidewalks and buses also had excellent space, attention, and resources.

(my druthers would be for private car ownership to be **mad uncomfortable**, but
we can't always get what we want)

Like Taiwan, I felt less like a guided tourist, and more "fish in someone else's
pond." Being here made me more motivated than I've felt in over a decade to
learn a new language. I'll come back, knowing a lot more Korean.

---

The most surprising thing about this trip was my internal state traveling
alone. Something that comes up a lot in therapy (and my conversations with
Saurya!) is how I need to improve at recognizing or grounding my wants and
needs. I'm often so eager to accomodate those around me, I avoid having to
address myself. This is likely related to my household and upbringing: my
brother and sister are also extremely conciliatory people, and neither of us has
taken a "bend the world to our will" style in our adult lives. It makes us
pleasant to be around and good community members, but at its worst, it's a bit
like Buster Bluth's ["a Milford Man is neither seen nor heard."][1]

This type of behavior is a crutch disguised as altruism: "Since it's for other
people, I'm actually very generous!," conveniently freeing you of having to
exercise any agency, or assume responsibility for outcomes. It's
failure-minimizing instead of success-maximizing. It's a more pernicious "you
miss 100% of the shots you don't take." Pablo: "I can't lose if I don't play!"

So when traveling alone, without much planning, or a set agenda, I had to pay
attention to… _me_. It sounds silly, but this was frequently terrifying! It's
like if you hedged your personal and professional happiness on how heavy a
weight you could lift with your weakest muscle. You'd _really_ prefer to use
your beefy quads or something.

(this manifests in other areas of my life: I've rarely been single, and when I
have been, I've been uncomfortable. My relationships often suffer from me not
articulating my needs, then getting miserable when they're not met. It's not a
great pattern.)

What all this feels like is alternatively anxiety-producing ("am I
doing the right thing? what do I even want? do I just think I want these things?
I'll be a failure if I don't DO THE RIGHT THING ALL THE TIME") and the most
creative and inspired I get (excitement to learn Korean, inspiration to learn
all those things I love again, delight at working according to my own
schedule/needs).

So this leg of the trip was a success. Because I made it so 😎

<p>This requires some explanation. This StarCraft player (<a href="">soO</a>) famously reached the top tournament finals (which almost nobody ever achieves) and got second place. He did this… six times. When he finally won, the Korean StarCraft 2 community <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/544182-korean-fans-celebrate-soos-championship-with-subway-advertisement">crowdfunded this subway ad</a> to celebrate his win.</p>

<p>I went to an arcade later and played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)">Pump It Up</a> (like Dance Dance Revolution). I did fine kids, but the bottle of soju was critical</p>
