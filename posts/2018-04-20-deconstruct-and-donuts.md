    og_description: I got accepted into Deconstruct, and want to celebrate my wins.

My proposal for a talk got selected, so I'll be speaking at [DeconstructConf][1]
this May! While I have some experience speaking to smaller audiences (and as an
actor about a decade ago), this is my first time speaking at a conference. The
title of my talk is **"A Fresh Look At Failure."**

Beyond announcing the talk, there are a few other narratives here that the blog
is a perfect place to explore. This was a big, personal-feeling win.

### Donuts üç©

[Lara Hogan][4] is an engineering leader who's published a lot of great work
(I included her [onsite engineering template][5] to my [Eng Interview resources
links][6]); one that I particularly love is her [Donut Manifesto][2]: celebrate
your career achievements! When she gets a win, she celebrates with a donut;
having my talk accepted motivated me to start [a donut page of my own,][3] since
I'll accept any reason to put more donuts in me üòã

I hope to add a few retroactive donuts, but more than that, I'd like to earn
some future ones!

### Deconstruct, as a conf

Deconstruct has these properties that I'm comfortable calling Objectively Good: 

* Diverse speaker lineup. People of all backgrounds participate in our industry
  and have lots to share; conferences should [aim to be part of the solution.][7]

* Speaker accommodations: most conferences place the burdens of travel and
  lodging on their speakers, and don't pay them for their time. This means a
  self-selecting, generally well-off set of people have an easier time speaking
  at conferences, and we lose perspectives as a result. The organizers took
  great care to provide as much as possible to counteract these forces.

* On that note: hey! A [Code of Conduct!][8] Scholarships, captioning, a
  dedicated room for mothers, gender-neutral restrooms, and badge text you
  select yourself! 

* Excellent resources on [choosing a talk topic][10] and [construction/preparation
  tips][9], published during [the CFP][11]!

Properties of Deconstruct that make it a great conference, per Pablo
preferences:

* Single-track: no FOMO! A more curated experience!

* Short(er) talks: Many ideas can be very well-expressed in 25 minutes,
  especially if the speaker puts in work to make their talk tight. You always want
  an audience to leave thinking "I wish I had more of that" instead of "that was
  great but could have been 10 minutes shorter."

* No sponsorships. It is very possible for a conference to responsibly have
  sponsors, but a lot of conference antipatterns emerge from imperfect
  implementations (conferences optimized for recruiting, influence on talk
  or speaker selection, etc.).

* Wide topic breadth: conferences around a single technology or topic are
  great! But I like that there's a conf where we can celebrate and look at
  computing more generally, at these levels of abstraction.

* Every one of [last year's talks][12] that I've watched has been a high-signal,
  thought-provoking use of my time.

As in everything, there are tradeoffs to every choice, but I'm delighted to be
part of a conference that makes these choices.

### A professional in computing

While being fully cognizant that "speaking at conferences" is a pretty common
way [engineers showboat and gatekeep each other][13], I do sincerily embrace the
joy and accomplishment I'm feeling about the idea that people may enjoy hearing
me talk about computers. It's been a long journey from when I was crying in
front of a [SunLab][14] computer feeling like an incapable failure, and it
wasn't obvious that the path would take me here. I almost quit the industry in 2013.
I've had to do a lot of work on myself [to keep going,][15] and there are
still plenty of challenges.

It's lovely to feel like I'm doing something that more resembles _thriving_
than merely _surviving._ My proposal was about a set of topics I've been
thinking about with private enthusiasm for years, and getting the chance to
share it with folks who may appreciate it the way I do is pretty thrilling.

---

I still have to **deliver** this talk, so I don't mean to shortchange the
effort, or celebrate something I haven't completed yet. But! Few things really
give me this kind or level of joy, so I want to allow it in too ‚ò∫Ô∏è
