    og_description: I take the prompt of an article I read and answer 20 questions about how I'm doing.

There'll be a bunch of us in nursing homes doing bodyweight exercises on the
floor with Dalgona coffee next to us and our adult children will be holding
paper coffee cups and be like "yeah, they lived through COVID. Let's go to the
gym."

A while ago I answered [questions that were meant to kill small talk,][1] tying
it back to the fun of chain mails we sent in Middle School. I saw an article
suggesting [a similar list of questions][2] to ask someone beyond "how are you
doing right now?" and thought I'd take a crack at answering them, rapid-fire.

I invite you to answer them too! If you write them in a blog post, do share! Or
in a comment. Or in a journal you keep to yourself üôÇ

### How are you taking care of yourself today?

Today? In _Animal Crossing,_ Karen doesn't know it yet but I built a little
graveyard, making a tombstone and sign for all the villagers who've left our
town ([little reminder][3]). I can't usually surprise her in the game since
she's with me all the time, but I found a few hours when she was on a call.

</div>

Made a fancy breakfast feast this morning.

### What part of your shelter-in-place residence have you come to appreciate the most?

Cooking. Going into an office in normal times and performing for such a long
stretch kills any energy I have at home, so I never really got into it. Working
right by my kitchen, I spend a lot of idle thoughts thinking about what I'd like
and what we have. I get to take 20-50 minutes to do something with my hands, get
nice smells, feel productive, and later eat something tasty.

The big enabler of this is working from home, which I **love.** Don't love the
reason, don't love the impacts, but love the lifestyle.

### What surprising thing have you been stocking up on (that isn‚Äôt toilet paper)?

Rolos, Boursin cheese, and Oreos.

### What's a story ‚Äì from a book, a movie, an article, a conversation ‚Äì that you‚Äôve been gripped by recently? Why did it capture you?

I'm normally blogging about them! But there are, on any given day, 10 tabs I
keep thinking "I should share this," then don't. Looking through them: [Ashley
Feinberg deducing which Supreme Court Justice flushed][10], [this comic][11],
[this comic][12], etc.

Have only mentioned here it in passing, but someone passed along a rec for a
series of paranormal romance novels (not teen fiction/YA like _Twilight_ or its
copycats; these are adult Romance novels, starring monsters in mostly human-form
who fuck, rather wildly). Yo, they are a **blast.** If you can get out of your
head enough to enjoy a Jason Statham movie, you'll probably find something to
like here.

</div>

### What habit have you started, or broken, during the quarantine?

Started: blogging more, the aforementioned cooking, using RSS as the primary news
driver, wearing a hat to keep my hair from falling in my face, especially when
it's wet ([this one][13]).

Broken: I stopped reading Twitter nearly as much. Almost everything I did around
diet and exercise has changed. That no-drinking thing got broken and [scared me
at one point][14] (it doesn't anymore).

### Which specific place in your neighborhood are you most looking forward to visiting once this is all over?

La Bagel Gourmet. I loved that Saturday Morning Bagel ritual.

### What's the easiest part about the quarantine?

Not having to wear the Human Suit for 8-10 hour stretches, away from things that
comfort me.

### What are some things you have realized that you don‚Äôt really need?

So much food prepared by other people.

Personal space, apparently.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">The Oddish and its many friends sliced and diced.</p>
</div>

### What's something you own that feels useful?

Haha, back in the salad days of StarCraft 2 (~2011), coinciding with
building my own computer for the first time, I got into streaming. I danced like
nobody was watching, because they weren't (except Friend of the Blog Ben, and
one of my friends I play D&D with. [here's an upload][15]). I haven't streamed
as much recently since my last few apartments have miserable upload, but wow
was it great to have a great webcam and headset.

### What is your Covid-19 nickname/alter-ego?

Man, idk. I made waves with my co-workers by sharing a recent love of butter
(I never would have guess that [this][33], of all articles, would provide such an
inordinate amount of joy in my life, at the age of 33). So maybe The Soft Butter
Haver?

### What problem‚Äîeither yours, or something more global‚Äîdo you wish you could solve?

Small-time: I wish I could have a KVM switch that solved dual-monitor on both my
Macbook and my PC. Most KVMs only support DVI or VGA (ancient cables that don't
give much resolution), and multi-monitor KVM is expensive, and the Macbook
doesn't take DisplayPort or HDMI (only _sleek, cool_ USB-C) and KVM switches
mogrify the signals in mysterious-to-me ways; all the reviews say "don't use
with an adapter," but, like, I don't have a choice when my laptop is an Apple.
I got one for HDMI connections but connected to my Macbook through a dock it
just says "No Signal" and the USB line is flaky as hell.

More global: I mean, it's all shit. Pack the courts, abolish the Senate, abolish
the Electoral College, abolish ICE, abolish prisons, decrim sex work, decrim
drugs, break up the monopolies, tax the rich, make a social safety net that
houses the homeless and feeds the hungry and treats our addicts, start a Free
Software revolution where we stop writing proprietary code and systems to
imprison and impoverish our neighors.

But really, I'd love some suggestions on the KVM thing; I got one but it doesn't
play well with my Macbook or my USB hub either.

## Getting deeper

They have a break in the original article saying these ones are more personal.

### What's something that you miss that surprises you? What‚Äôs something that you don‚Äôt miss that surprises you?

I find myself missing social functions more than I thought I would. It's still
substantially less than most people are missing it, but it's more than I
thought. Been a _long_ time since I was ever thinking "I wish someone would have
a birthday party by saying "we're meeting at the bar at 9:00"
where we all lose our hearing in a crowded, overpriced hellhole, not actually
able to speak to our friends, and being reminded we're not in our 20's, and it
was a bad idea then too." But I did.

I never blogged about it, but Rocco, Karen's dog from before we dated, lives
with another family now. The decision we made to re-home him has been
totally positive for him and us, but the hardest parts of living with him
came from his behavior when we weren't home, and the obstacles that came from
both of us working office jobs at startups; now that both are moot, he'd be a
great dog to have in this situation.

I've said it a lot, but I miss the gym.

Surprised how little I miss all my normal "outside meals," because they were
usually the high point of my day. Meals are still the high point, but not tied
to specifically what I used to eat.

### Which member of your family/ friend group have you been thinking about the most during this time? Why?

[I wrote a bit about it,][21] but my siblings, since they're at substantially more
risk than me. My parents and grandparents, since they're in the dangerous age
range.

### What's the most generous act you‚Äôve seen recently?

I do like the 7:00PM clapping. It's cheesy, it's more for the clappers than the
workers, and we really should just be paying/making guarantees for the essential
workers and medical staff; like the 9/11 responders and our vets, they're 
getting screwed pretty hard. But I like that there's something, because it
reminds me how I feel about them: I think people working frontline jobs are
being incredibly generous with their one and only lives. I wish there was
commensurate reward, or it didn't feel like many delivery workers were forced
because of the US's barbarism towards the poor.

### What's the last thing you experienced that made you laugh, or cry?

Laugh: the Chiitan clips from [this Last Week Tonight][22] episode.

Cry: I can't remember. Probably therapy or a breakdown.

### What times of the day or the week are hardest?

Tuesdays hurt. I'm thankfully still employed but I do a lot of work that I'm
proud of on Mondays and by the end of Tuesday I tend to crash, realizing that I
can't keep that pace, looking at the mountain of things I'd like to have done.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Huevos con frijol. It was delicious.</p>
</div>

### What's giving you hope right now?

The Youth. The generation or two after Millenials seem to have their heads on
pretty right. They're joyful, justice-oriented, and creative in
the face of a boiling planet they'll suffer from harder than their parents.

Speedrunners. I'm serious. Playing a video game is an activity I understand and
relate to, so seeing the level of creativity and determination to beat one as
quickly as possible reminds me how genius humans can be in other problem
domains that worry me, like climate or public policy. If we can do [Watch For
Rolling Rocks with a 0.5 A presses][23], goddamn, we can do anything.

### What's the best thing that happened to you today?

I was lying in bed, Karen came to gave me a hug, then Sapo climbed on Karen. We
have a joke in DC about how many "guy on a horse" statues we have, and I want a
"Pablo hugged by Karen climbed by Sapo" statue, if I ever do something
honorable.

### How do you want this experience to change you? How do you think it will?

I'd like to come out with more clarity about what works, what doesn't, what
constraints on my life feel like they're external but are actually internal. I
didn't choose to have everything shifted around this way, but since it was, I'll
try to make the best of it, be as introspective as I can.

### What do you hope we all learn or take away from this experience?

Whatever we need to.

Okay, that's a cheap answer. But it is what I believe most? We're going to rise
to the occasion or be miserable, self-defeating apes. I'm not going to pretend
to know what should come next, since the clownishness of recent reality
demonstrates that whatever I've been anchoring my standards on before was
not an anchor at all.
