    og_description: Today's things I read + reacted to: organizing vs.  mobilizing, how long we'll be doing this, and bailouts.

I loved this:

Also, my extended family (most in the DC area) had our first virtual Happy Hour.
I wasn't prepared for how much it helped me. Try this! With your friends and/or
workspaces!

### Timeframes!

Kottke shared [an article called _We may be in this for the long haul_][2], and
the most interesting thing for me was the implication that people expect this
disruption to last "a few weeks." I've never been under this impression, but
seeing it written out, I wouldn't be surprised if other people (most?)
are. Not through conscious calculation, just that most people only think a few
weeks out, and are more focused on the present, especially with so much
changing so quickly.

I suspect we'll be home quarantining for 1-3 months at least, social
distancing/remote working/reduced hours for a good while longer, and over a year
_or two_ before institutions and markets restore to some semblance of rhythms
and normalcy. We haven't begun to slow the inflection of the curve in the States
yet, and "flattening the curve," as much as we can do it, flattens it against
_time._ If we succeed, this will be a longer process!

It doesn't help at all that _we can't get tested in large numbers and American
healthcare is a barbaric hellscape,_ so we never know how well we're doing, or
when we should go back to normal. [Democrats need to be doing better pointing
out Republican failures][7], but to quote Alex Pareene, the opposition party is
seemingly afraid of politics.

But yeah, start soaking in this tub. It'll be a while.

### Bailouts!

I really love Matt Levine's _Money Stuff_ newsletter (usually don't read it to
completion; there's often a lot of it). One thing I think he does well
is putting something really meaty at the top of it, and [the first
section of today's newsletter][8] (on shareholder interests, stock buybacks,
corporate profits, and bailouts) is especially good. We'll probably capitulate
and let the same crooks run everything, but goddammit we should bleed them dry.

Unsurprisingly, [Elizabeth Warren has concrete suggestions on which conditions
to put on those buybacks][9] that align with worker interests and long-term
better governance.

### Power, anger, organizing

While cooking today, I listened to [an episode of The Ezra Klein show][3], which
is normally not my bag, but he had an accomplished labor organizer (Jane
McAlevey) on to talk about the differences between activism, mobilizing, and
organizing, with a focus on how the left approaches power. It was very
enlightening! I've got more to listen to, but I often have a hard time getting
my feelings out of the way when talking with people who disagree with me, and
this offered a great framework for thinking about how to have those
conversations more productively. A **ton** of anger between progressive camps,
especially on Twitter, can get a lot from this.

I was cooking [this][4], which is a favorite. It's super easy, and open to
adjustment (subbed seitan for the chicken which was a mistake, and always add a
fuckton more vegetables and mushrooms).

### Blogging!

In a stray bullet point, John Scalzi [mentioned he's posting more on his blog
too!][1] Add it to your RSS, he's been in the blogging game for decades and
while he never stopped, it was obvious many "would-be" blog posts became Tweets.

Some of his biggest hits:

- [Being poor][5]
- [What I think about Atlas Shrugged][6], which spawned _When The Yogurt Came_,
  which was animated in Netflix's _Love, Death, and Robots._

Start a blog! Blog more! Share it! Let's make a webring!
