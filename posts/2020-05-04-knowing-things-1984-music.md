    og_description: "knows things" produces lots of weird awful systems. A cool music video.

One challenge of Internet Brain Poison is how much excellent terminology
you come to rely on that isn't shared parlance. There are a few engineers I've
playfully wanted to call "mother's food must be very hot"-types and that's not
obvious to most unless you've spent too much time on the places that I have.
[Luke O'Neil wrote an explainer][1] I might have linked, but [Media Being Media,
that shit's gone][2] and it's not on Internet Archive.  

That said, Internet Brain Poison quotes are really good for things like
[Quiplash][4] or [Dixit.][3] Pulling out ["If not I will face
God and walk backwards into hell!"][5] or "never speak to me or my son ever
again" tends to get good reactions, even after you credit them appropriately.
Other brain-poisoned people will Laugh Knowingly.

### Knowing things

I had a lot of reactions, some of which quite visceral, on this [Vox writeup of
education going remote][11], mostly on the invasive shit people are having to
install and run to fail to prevent cheating:

> When student Marium Raza learned that her online biochemistry exam at the
> University of Washington would have a digital proctor, she wanted to do her
> research. The system, provided by a service called Proctorio, would rely on
> artificial intelligence and a webcam to monitor her while she worked.

My first thought: _do they have 10,000s of hours of labeled footage of people
cheating on exams from a webcam view to train this? Do they have it of students
from all different backgrounds?_ lol of course not. They're selling something
that sucks to desperate people that's going to flag students as cheating when
they're not.

(my curmudgeoney thoughts on AI [here][12] and [here][13]. It's similar to
[blockchain hype of the early 2010s][14]).

"Verify someone knows something," testing, and grading are pretty hard
problems that share a lot with this problem domain. For years, one of my
favorite article genres was "confessions of the essay mill writer," where
someone shares observations from the job of writing middling, passable papers
for the masses of people who need them to pass classes. Some examples are
[here][16] and [here][15].

While there are obviously a lot of people getting credentials that don't deserve
them, in my passive observation at an Ivy (and going to fancy, expensive
private school before that), I can tell you this happens _a lot_, at every
level, without the essay mills. Credentialism still works on smooth-brained
people, but anyone with a brain knows not to trust most elite markers for
anything other than "comes from wealth," or "well-connected," which, depending
on your goals, may matter a great deal. Remember how [43% of White students at
Harvard][16] are legacies, "students of interest" to the dean (i.e. paid money,
Kushner-style), athletes, or related to donors or staff? That's cool. 

A lot of the world made more sense when I stopped looking at what systems
_stated_ or _intended_ and instead on what they _produced_. Looking at that, the
systems and rules we have around education do, in fact, educate some people, but
it's clear what we call the "education system" has a lot of other goals and
effects that aren't nearly as noble.

related-topics-but-I-have-to-work: subverting traditional schooling, like with 
homeschooling (lmao not writing a pithy summary on this one), time-limited
closed-book tests (solves exactly one set of problems), lecture-format
classes (works for only a few types of people, makes many others think they're
dummies), job compliance courses on things like sexual harassment or security
(more about ass-covering than learning, but we have to make a sincere show
that it's the other way around), how this all ties to the performance and
narratives of intelligence.

anyway, click the links, form your own opinions, and reminder that I'm a product
of these systems and have benefitted from them.

### Fun mashup

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">While I much prefer <em>A Mighty Wind</em>, Spinal Tap is a delightful artifact of 1984.</p>
</div>

I liked this mashup of 1984's music. 1984 is, in my mind, The Beginning of
History, because that's when my brother was born, so Dwight and Pilar stopped
being two random newlyweds and started "my family."
