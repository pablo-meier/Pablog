    og_description: Another character for a new game I'm playing. Large Man.

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNsLrw0SkCQ">Zangief's Theme</a>, by Yoko Shimomura for Street Fighter II</em> üéµ</small>

New game! The game [Fin][7] was part of is wrapping up, and as you might
imagine, a lot of us are able to play more frequently than normal. A friend is
DMing a game in the campaign setting [_Blades in the Dark_][9], which describes
itself as:

> a tabletop role-playing game about a crew of daring
> scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an
> industrial-fantasy city. There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous
> bargains, bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had ‚Äî if you‚Äôre bold
> enough to seize them.

The "industrial-fantasy city" is Doskvol:

> An industrial world under perpetual night, long after some great catastrophe
> has relegated the sun to storybooks, and resulted in the ghosts of the dead
> lingering in the world. With players taking the role as members of a criminal
> organization such as thieves, smugglers, or merchants of some illicit goods.
> Players grind their way up the criminal underworld by seizing money, territory
> and infamy.

So this character:

- Is part of a "crew," which has its own mechanics, richer than the standard
  "adventuring party."
- The crew are criminals who hope to score enough to Retire And Be Legends, Man.
- Each playsession is a "score," a job the crew does to increase their
  reputation or notoriety. You gotta watch out for the feds ("bluecoats") and
  also manage relationships with other crews and turf.
- You tend to need a nickname, mine has two for reasons that'll become clear.

Some background: despite [most of my other characters][8] I'm playing a martial
character for a change. "It's not a Pablo character if they don't die to a hard
punch," so this one is intended to get bruised up (but survive!) pretty often.
Our crew does all sorts of jobs, but specializes in smuggling cargo of the
"occult" or "weird" variety. Also, Cosimo is another PC, we agreed to link our
backstories.

Anyway, meet Sioqur, cast an Andr√© the Giant in my head (for now, not super sure
of that choice):

### Sioqur "The Liver": Backstory

Virtually everyone living in the Imperium has stories of when the environment
imposed a hardship on them, and Sioqur's family was no exception. A
modest-but-comfortable fishing family, he was used to eating his fill on fresh
catch, and had fun as a boy wrestling heavier specimens that tried to jump off
the boat back in the water. But some hunters were chasing an aggressive
Leviathan far too close to their Dagger Isles port, damaging their
infrastructure and killing (or scaring) much of the sea life for miles.
His family was forced to work for an outpost of neighboring turf, owned by
a Mondvelian noble.

They were not kind. This outpost was run by the third Mondvel son Armas, who
took them in and put them to work, but only giving them access to scraps,
rotting inventory, and entrails. Sioqur was often pushed into violent
enforcement work on behalf of the landlords given his obvious strength (maritime
diet is high-protein and low-calorie, after all!) while the rest of his family
did more traditional fishing work. When another family in a similar serfdom-like
situation accused his brother and father of stealing from the landlords, they
were sentenced to brutal punishment: his father was thrown into a dungeon, and
his brother into "short-term jobs," so-called because the work was 
suicidally dangerous, and few lasted long doing it. As they were getting
carted off, his brother told him "use the chum to catch the prize" with a wink,
referring to cutting and dropping a recently-caught fish back into the ocean to
lure a better one. Sioqur knew what he meant: "we're done for, use us as chum to
leave this fate."

Sioqur took all his contraband savings from his hidey-hole, bribed a few of
Armas' men, and executed a heist of one of their fishing boats, stealing it with
other laborors Seskel and Zayin. The three sailed toward Doskvol. Knowing a)
they didn't have enough money to start a life on the other side, and b) the
boat was "hot" and in pursuit by the Mondvel family, they sold it off to start
anew. Zayin, the most entrepreneurial, started busking, then asked the other two
to do sketch shows.

It was a disaster! Their comedy was bad! But the fight scenes drew a crowd. They
started staging more elaborate ones. Sioqur became a crowd favorite under the
guise "Cirrhosis," dropped his Dagger Isles identity in favor of a "wild horse
man from Severos" identity (he'd cover himself in animal blood), and their
"fight shows" drew pretty consistent crowds. They branded their fights as "The
Dream Pits," with a campy "fighting tournament, winner gets a wish granted!"
narrative.

During one of their traveling shows, he built rapport with one of the stage
hands building a temporary stage named Cosimo, the only one who was curious
rather than disgusted with Sioqur's organ-heavy, overseasoned diet. Cosimo and
Sioqur became friends, "two large guys bein' large." Hearing he was an
occasional vagrant and knowing that pain, The Dream Pits let him travel with
them when he needed a place to live.

Their show was no stranger to the underworld‚Äîillicit betting, drugs, vice,
bribery‚ÄîSioqur and Zayin worked to keep it extralegal but professional. "Believe
it or not there are rules to this shit," one gang member told him. They lost
Seskel to a stage trick gone wrong which turned out to have been orchestrated by
one of his debtors. And they were extremely careful about the Mondvel family's
presence, of which the Dagger Isles port was only an offshoot.

But he often thought of his family. He thought of the hardship the other
families endured. He had nightmares of Armas frequently, and wanted to burn his
docks to the ground. He remembered: Armas had a fondness and a hobby for the
"weird," and would trade with people in Doskvol for new occult oddities. Sioqur
kept his eyes open for work in that trade. If he played his cards right, he
could decorate with (and perhaps dine on) the guts of the man who crushed every
life around him that mattered.

###  Details:

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Zangief is another inspiration, here in his very cool "SNK-style" illustration.</p>
</div>

Like a luchador: grapple/striking-heavy styles (no blades, weapons might be,
like, a chair or a ladder). More acrobatic than his size would suggest (flying
leaps!). His persona on stage is "Cirrhosis," so his nickname in the group is
"the liver" (he also got pretty hooked on animal entrails as a food, and eats
organ meat whenever he can). He, naturally, uses different masks for his stage
persona and his heist work.

**Playbook:** Cutter.

**Heritage:** Dagger Isles, but pretends/exaggerates the horse nomad "wildness"
of Severos.

**Background:** Labor.

**Close Friend:** Zayin, fight promoter/organizer/producer for The Dream Pits.

**Rival:** Armas Mondvel (or really anyone from the Mondvel family).

**Vice:** Obligation, but not family or church, but his "second crew" of The
Dream Pits. He really, really needs the thrill of performance and a crowd to
properly de-stress, will seek out "violent drama" if left alone (bar fights are
a favorite).

**Look:**
 - Sioqur: Large man, happiest when he's sweating, mouth usually isn't closed.
 - Cirrhosis: covered in appropriative "tribal markings" and animal blood,
   sometimes wearing a large skull as a helmet, or a bone in his hair,
   loincloths. He plays a few masked characters too.

### Inspirations

<video style="display: block; max-width: 95%; width: 800px;" autoplay loop><source src="/img/2020/5/luchador.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">There is honestly something wrong with you if you can't appreciate elements of Lucha Libre.</p>

I started with the idea "if I had to play someone huge/strong, who am I excited
to play as?" and frankly, that's a luchador.

The family's story is very "Grapes of Wrath dustbowl." The brother
saying "leave us behind" comes from a novel I read where the protagonist
effectively sentences his family to death by betraying the rich family he worked
for. The failed sketch comedy before showfighting had me thinking of [Rainer
Wolfcastle's "that's the joke."][4] "Believe it or not there are rules to this
shit" is said by a crime-lord antagonist in Netflix's _Luke Cage._

The Dream Pits is very ["King of the Iron Fist tournament" from the _Tekken_
games,][5] with touches of [_Bailando por un Sue√±o_][6], which aired when I was
finishing high school. But it _really_ (and Sioqur's arc, generally) fits in my
mind like a _Twisted Metal_ game, where the Dream Pits is where they tell
Calypso contest narraties, while he himself is in his own. Doskvol being _dark
and moody_ was a bit of a challenge for me, but I remember loving the way
_Twisted Metal: Black_ did it. Here's Mr. Grimm's story, for instance:

### Notes, goals

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/5/rafael_fe_THUMB.png" alt="Rafael from Fire Emblem" style="margin: 15px auto; max-width: 95%; width: 500px;" />
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Rafael from <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> is also an inspiration, and one of my favorite characters in the game.</p>

Professional wrestling is fucking wild, man. From a raw spectacle + performance
angle, as well as gettin' swole. You could really do worse than read [this
award-winning essay][1] on the labor issues involved, or see [this Last Week
Tonight][2] episode.

Additionally, wrestling as storytelling is something powerful. I almost got a
tattoo saying _Kayfabe_ since I think it's a distillation/explanation of forces
that guides most of our lives. See [this explanation here][3], but this pull is
a good summary:

> Although the etymology of the word is a matter of debate, for at least 50
> years "kayfabe" has referred to the unspoken contract between wrestlers and
> spectators: We‚Äôll present you something clearly fake under the insistence that
> it‚Äôs real, and you will experience genuine emotion. Neither party acknowledges
> the bargain, or else the magic is ruined.
>
> To a wrestling audience, the fake and the real coexist peacefully. If you ask
> a fan whether a match or backstage brawl was scripted, the question will seem
> irrelevant. You may as well ask a roller-coaster enthusiast whether he knows
> he‚Äôs not really on a runaway mine car. The artifice is not only understood but
> appreciated: The performer cares enough about the viewer‚Äôs emotions to want to
> influence them. Kayfabe isn‚Äôt about factual verifiability; it‚Äôs about
> emotional fidelity.

Anyway, here's hoping I don't die too soon üòõ
