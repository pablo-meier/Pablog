    og_description: Engineering is weird work, so talking about hours is weird too

<small>ðŸŽµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKqgE4BwAY">Gimme Chocolate!!</a>, by BABYMETAL.</em> ðŸŽµ</small>

I heard an anecdote about a bunch of [honchos][1] of a company having a
leadership meeting, discussing headcount. One of company's non-technical leaders
said: "I looked into it and your engineers, on average, clock in at 11:00AM.
Don't tell me you need more resources, manage your team better to work normal
hours."

This is a contentious topic. I heard this and had a few reactions that don't fit
into Twitter.

### Simple math

I'll start by stating the obvious: of course adding more time to someone's
work schedule, _all other things being equal_, will mean more output. If you
came in at 9:00 instead of 11:00 and worked the whole time, over 5 days of a
week you're adding 10 more hours. Think of what 10 more hours of
weekly exercise does to your health! Or 10 hours of weekly piano practice!
10 hours ain't nuthin'.

I've experienced this. At my first startup gig where I was 1/3 of the
engineers, I produced _a lot_ of code. I was asked a few times how I was able to
ship so much, and the best model I could come up with was: "I start working at
9:30, others get in at 11:15, I think part of it is that I just plug in more
hours."

A talk I linked in [an earlier post][14] argued "exercise is massively
overindexed as an important part of weight loss" but opened with the line "to be
clear: I do believe in thermodynamics!" _Sure_, if you burn more calories than
you consume, you will find that energy from somewhere, and that will come from
your body eating itself; physics is real. But the rest of [that 40 minute
talk][16] described how thermodynamics, while real, somehow isn't enough of a
force such that exercise will meaningfully enable long-term weight loss for most
people, and I think a similar force is at play here. **Believing that
working hours is a major input on an engineer's effectiveness is shortsighted,
and if you're a manager (or especially a non-technical leader), you'll shoot
yourself in the foot applying traditional work models.**

### lmao culture

Atypical working hours are more common in software than most other white-collar
jobs (think consulting, banking, or finance). That alone doesn't mean it's
acceptable, but it might suggest there are deeper reasons for this behavior,
given that it's so prevalent.

Now, if asked "why do engineers show up in T-Shirts at 11:00?" and you answered

> capitalists collectively invested billions into college-aged privileged boys,
> glorifying "boy king" narratives while demanding little accountability (often
> _rewarding_ [childish][2], [irresponsible][3] [tendencies][4] and
> [practices][5]), and as a result tech company culture is often more like a
> fraternity or treehouse rather than a collection of intelligent adults trying
> to build a value-producing, sustainable, civically-responsible business

I'd 1000% agree with you. That's a huge part of it, tech culture is fucked, and
we should fix that too. But that's not all of it.

I'd argue engineering is _creative work_, and this optimizes for a different
employee base and different work habits than many other professional classes to
which it's superficially similar. The best analogy I can think of is ad
agencies (think of the [fancy offices where they have, like, hammocks and
shit][17]), or the inside of a TV show's writer's room (for most people, the
closest you've seen to this is [the cast of _30 Rock_][18], where you have
disgusting Frank but also Harvard-graduate Twofer).

### Who gets into engineering

It's worth remembering that learning engineering is a pretty heavily-gated
process. Like playing a musical instrument, it doesn't come naturally or intuitively.
You have to push through a lot of failure, practice deliberately, and the best
engineers I know can be described as "having stepped on thousands of rakes."
Often you don't have a teacher figure to give you gold stars along the way, and
you need enough time and motivation from somewhere to learn it (to say nothing
of access to technology, or overcoming everyone's shitty biases if you're
underrepresented).

You're normally doing large parts of that journey in isolation. Most programmers
[don't read code recreationally,][9] many don't "code socially." Bringing them
into a team environment is often an adjustment, and no two shops have the same
tech. Hell, I've been at 4 companies using Flask for backends, and _nobody_ did
it similar to the others (being real though, a lot of that is how little Flask
gives you, and Python ðŸ˜›)

All this to say: for many engineers, the skills in the craft didn't come from
the same places as clocking in early with a freshly-ironed clothes or well-kept
hair.<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">1</a></sup> This doesn't mean we're
"special creatures" you have to coddle (we are just people) but the profession
attracts a different sort than those who always show up on time and paint in the
lines.

(I'd argue that many white-collar jobs lean on these things to because the
_appearance_ of competence or success is actually how many of them are graded.
But that's much larger essay, and frankly, [SWE also judges a lot by
appearances.][10])

### Good management cares about its people

Tim Chevalier (has since protected their tweets) said something I liked
(paraphrased): "many managers disallow remote work because they don't know how
to evaluate an engineer's performance without the associations from seeing them
around the office." In a world where most people are only okay at their jobs, I
suspect many managers tweak the easy knobs ("come in early") rather determine
what success means for that company, do deep work to learn which work is
required, creating an environment for many types of individuals to do that work,
then seeing if it got done. They'd rather feel in their gut "so-and-soâ€¦ I feel
great after conversations with her!"

And to go back to the "creative class" bits: software is home to many
types of people. I [struggle with depression.][15] Here's [Leigh Honeywell][11]
discussing a recent ADHD diagnoses, with resources.  Here's [tef][13] discussing
the same. It could be that your engineers have a medical diagnosis and they've
structured their life knowing what's best for themselves. If you're hung up on
getting them to show up at a certain hour, there's a good chance you're going to
lose good people.

### Market forces: A funny time to be an engineer

This is an interesting and weird few decades to be a software engineer. On the
whole, we don't know what we're doing. Everything we write is [about as secure
from attack as thick cardboard.][6] Our chips and hardware are millions of times
faster than it was 20 years ago but [the experience of _using_ a computer still
feels much the same][12] because our "improvements" to software have a funny
treadmill quality on code efficiency. While this article contains many
simplifications, there's something to be said for [arguments to not call us
"engineers,"][7] since that work is normally reserved for people
applying hard science and rigor, which most of the time, we're not.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2018/8/xkcd_voting_software_THUMB.png" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">yup. <a href="https://xkcd.com/2030/">link to original</a></p>
</div>

But, with all that in mind: _we're swimming in job opportunities._ Code is
terrible, but everyone wants someone who can write it.

Some folks make the case that one day, software jobs [will look more like
blue-collar machine operation,][8] but right now, that's not the typical case.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">2</a></sup>
Software engineers are the worst, except for everybody else.

### So

I forget who said it, but: "not working hard enough is almost never the cause of
your company's issues. It's often a symptom."

If it isn't clear: I don't think telling people to "just come in earlier" will
work out too well for you. I understand the frustration, but I think this is
better-suited demonstrating empathy. Chances are, there's a cost to cranking the
easiest, surface-level knob.

<span id="footnote2">1.</span> <a href="#place2"><strong>^</strong></a> Nor is
the [converse][20] or [inverse][19] true! A lot of excellently-groomed folks who come
in at 9:00 are _fantastic_ engineers, and there are many messy nerds who aren't
that great at coding.

<span id="footnote1">2.</span> <a href="#place1"><strong>^</strong></a> There's
another, longer set of blog posts arguing that the main force holding this back
are engineers; we often optimize for _feeling smart_ when we work. This means a
lot of innovation and investment cycle between solving problems that have
already been solved elsewhere, or problems that don't actually exist.

Similarly, we could make our foundations a lot more solid, but choose not to
because it would require a ton of coordination which is less fun than
building and re-building.
