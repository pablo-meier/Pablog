I got the 200th strawberry of _[Celeste][1]_ a game [I first played last year][2]
and loved. I uploaded videos for the previous two major achievements (completing
[6b][3] and [8b][4] without dying), here's the video for 7b. Note, the sound
didn't record. play your favorite music!

Until last week, when [they released the DLC _Farewell_][5], this would have
meant that I did everything there was to do in _Celeste._  I'm not sure I'll aim
for the two strawberries of Farewell: getting a Golden is **hard**, it requires
nearly flawless play for several minutes; 7b here is the hardest at ~9
minutes, and _Farewell_ takes speedrunners over 20 minutes, while being composed
of harder screens. But hey, I might still.

This was a major achievement for me. I've never been good at sticking with
something; proverbially, I'm a decent sprinter, but a terrible marathoner.
When I started futzing with the idea of getting the goldens, it was definitely a
"see how far we get" mode; only when I got 6b did I think "holy shit, I might
just get them all."

This makes me very happy.
