Haven't written anything substantive: head buried in work, but more relevant, 
headspace isn't great. As [this piece says right in its opening:][1]

Nothing to worry about! But some days are better than others, some weeks better
than others, and I can be satisfied with how I'm juggling things while also
acknowledging I'm usually juggling more in better times.

But here's a picture of Sapo I took (and liked):

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2020/4/sapo_in_bed.jpg" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2020/4/sapo_in_bed_THUMB.jpg" alt="Sleepy dog. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</a>
</div>

and here's a video that worked well on me:

<iframe width="800" height="450" style="max-width: 95%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XwaH-qT4Rm0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
