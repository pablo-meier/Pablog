I was linked to a post on [Uses This][1], a site which interviews productive
people about what their "setup" looks like. I find that most formal education is
about producing outcomes and sometimes waxed poetic about the how, but the
tactics of the how we work are reached organically, often radically
different between people.

This is an area rife with [engineer showboating][2], so please don't read
any of this as "these are best" or "you should do this." Use what works! That
said, contact me if you'd like to go deeper on any of this (my PC build, my
configuration files, what I used to learn). Also, share yours, or a blog post of
yours, in the comments! ðŸ˜„

### What hardware do you use?

I'll split this in three: my laptop (where I do most of my coding), my home
desktop for games and streaming, and my phone.

For engineering, I'm almost always on whatever the brand of MacBook Pro my
company got me. I tried to be Cool and used a Linux laptop at
Google and the laptop right after leaving, but it just wasn't worth the pain. I
spent a fair bit on a ThinkPad hearing it was the best laptop for Linux, but it
never slept or woke up properly, the screen was lo-res, sound was a disaster,
and Wi-Fi never worked. I felt "I'm an engineer! I should be able to make
Linux work!" but it was absolutely not worth the pain. Just get a Mac (or a
Windows, if you prefer).

The most odd thing about my engineering setup is that I don't work effectively
with accoutrements. Most SWEs I know have external keyboards, mice, trackpads,
standing desks, or keyboard trays. Most use a large external monitor, or
multiple monitors, some turn a widescreen monitor on its side for more vertical
space.

My desk has a bunch of stuffed toys. Every morning I pull out my laptop, use the
laptop's keyboard and trackpad, on the laptop's screen, and nothing else. This
is how I learned to code, and I find it more alienating than not to have the
other doodads. It feels a bit of [Jack Kirby's desk:][3]

</a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Jack Kirby played an instrumental role in nearly every superhero you know.</p>
</div>

My headphones are, stereotypically, Sennheiser 280s. I liked these before they
got super popular with engineers, who did the same research I did, _en masse_,
and made them the Official Google headphones, so most Googlers you meet have
them.

My phone is a Pixel. My first two companies (Adobe and Google)
were attacked by Apple over smartphones, so I switched to Android
in 2010 and haven't looked back. I hate a lot of what Apple does in this space
([censoring artists][4], [removing the headphone jack][5], ["we think you're
stupid" marketing][6] that largely works), and while Android and others do much
of the same, Apple's fans are more annoying and in greater denial, so I hold on
to Android. I'm usually on the flagship Google phone, but they went to
luxury pricing on the Pixel line (Nexus was better) and removed the headphone
jack too, so this is probably the last before I go to Moto or Samsung.

As for my desktop, the full build is hard to list here, but it's probably the
most deliberate "for pleasure" thing I spend money on. There are lots of vanities I
don't spend on (clothes, fancy dinners, fancy alcohol), but I've invested
significant time and money researching and building this PC. You'd think I play more
games than I do; I play _maybe_ a few hours a week. It's a big toy, like those
guys with gas-inefficient aggressively-named neon cars from the last century in
their garages.

I use a Razer DeathAdder and a Filco Majestouch with blue switches, tenkeyless.
This is what [FruitDealer used in the first GSL.][7]

### And what software?

I use [Firefox Nightly][8] as my personal browser, and Chrome for work. Aside from
supporting a free internet by using a browser not provided by an ad company
(or an OS company, or a device companyâ€¦) Nightly is just blazingly fast now, and
a pleasure to use.

I have a full-screen [iTerm2][10] open that uses `[zsh][9]`. I got into `zsh`
when I was younger because it's what Cool Engineers used, but I don't use enough
of the shell to _really_ feel the difference between it and `bash`. 

I manage two `[tmux][11]` sessions, one for work tabs and one for play. In all my
programming environments, I use [Inconsolata-g][15] at a larger font than most
programmers, dark themes, and Vim keybindings.

While I do a lot of shell + vim, for most of my on-the-job programming
I'm almost always on a JetBrains IDE (Intellij, PyCharm). I'm not a
wizard with those, and they're almost always misconfigured so I'm using my shell
to build and run tests. But they have enough utility regarding linting and
catching common errors that I work in them.

I capture spare thoughts and TODOs in [Google Keep][12], which works well on my
phone. I also use Firefox Nightly on Android when I can. This is my home screen:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
  <a href="/img/2018/3/home_screen.png" target="blank">
  <img src="/img/2018/3/home_screen_THUMB.png" alt="Pablo's home screen. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
  </a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I also have a Starbucks habit. They're ubiquitous! And those spinach-feta wraps are the perfect size of food.</p>
</div>

You'll notice that Twitter and Facebook aren't on there; I moved them further
away since I'm trying to use them less.

### What would be your dream setup?

This is hard to say. In theory, there's nothing really stopping me from building
whatever I'd define as "ideal" (and in a way, I've done that with my game setup).
But it's hard to honestly imagine any doodad that will make me feel more
productive on my machines; I mostly notice the things that block me, and have a
harder time finding things that empower me. And the things that block me aren't
usually around technical capability, or saving keystrokes, it's largely the
consequences of social factors that make certain projects or initiatives
feasible or not.

I do dream of learning to type in [Colemak][13], and writing fun things on a
mini keyboard like these, from [/r/mechanicalkeyboards][14]:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</a>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I look at pictures like these a lot. Really, I think I'm drawn to the storyline of being the type of person with Deep Thoughts, typing on a small, clacky keyboard, more than actually doing what's necessary to be such a person.</p>
</div>

I dream of an laptop and OS that work with essentials as well as MS or Apple
devices (WiFi, battery, screen resolution + brightness), looks like a UNIX
but uses more cutting-edge OS tech (ZFS for starters), and is Free Software.

I dream of a smartphone that is as hackable as old OSes are. Apple and Microsoft
are trying to make their computers harder for people to casually write programs
in, and they did this to their mobile OSes; there are good reasons for this, but
it's getting further from a world where we own our own devices and can
subsequently do interesting things with them. Said with metaphor: I'd rather our
computers remain as full-stocked kitchens we can cook in rather than microwaves
we can only reheat the work of other kitchens in.
