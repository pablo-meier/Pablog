    og_description: Resurrect posting after a long time off, celebrating my birthday and continuing to cook.

I turned 34! Wow, the time flies. It feels like, not yesterday, but like, _two
months ago_ that I left home to start college. Like many people, "I don't
want to go back, but I don't want to get much older either." I'm healthier than
I've been before, mentally and physically, and wouldn't trade that grounded
feeling for youth again (this might change if my back starts hurting). My dad
always used to say "youth is wasted on the young," and I get more and more clear
on what that means every year. 

Karen surprised me with a gift somewhat reminiscent of [Amado][1], which was
conceived as a gift for her üòõ. She coordinated with friends from all aspects of
my life (my HS friends, college friends, coworkers, tabletop game friends,
family) to send me photos of them having a milkshake, which was always my
birthday ritual. It was a complete blast, and I was **super** touched. If you
can, please celebrate my birthday by treating yourself with something you like.

(I'd love to post some photos, but idk who would be okay with that, and some of
the [descriptions of ClearView][7] show striking ability to see who's behind a mask
or a simple black bar over the eyes, so better safe than sorry. [Great relevant
30 Rock joke.][8])

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">The little broseph got to lick out the inside of the cup when I was done. Also, light "when you see it" vibes.</p>

I also did a "virtual escape room" with a few friends; it was super fun, if
you're looking for a team "offsite" or event in COVID times, I've done both
virtual games of [Puzzle Break][5] and liked them ton.

### Cooking

A friend who's been vegan for many years of her life took me
on as something of a prot√©g√© when she heard this was something I'm moving
towards. She found me a vegan milkshake in Brooklyn (from [NextLevel
Burger][3]), taught me about [JustEgg][4] for morning scrambles, and other
delicious things. So more of my diet is vegan that it was when I last blogged.
There's still more to go, but I'm going gradually.

Cooked a few things that I liked: I accidentally got way too many yams, so I'm
looking to  put them in everything. I made a yam stew with an Instant Pot we
hadn't used much, it came out pretty delicious:

  <a href="/img/2020/9/soup_2.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/9/soup_2_THUMB.jpg" alt="In go the veggies to stir-fry for a bit." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>

And the other day I made vegan protein pancakes, with banana and blueberry.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
  <a href="/img/2020/9/pancakes_1.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/9/pancakes_1_THUMB.jpg" alt="Ingredients at the ready: a mixing bowl with dry powders, and a bowl with mashed bananas and wet ingredients." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>

I'm not cooking quite as actively as I did in April, but now that I've been back
for almost a month, I'm starting to settle into some rhythms again.

### Functioning

It's hard! And not always happening! Shit sucks, guys, and I'm not always
okay!!!

cool, just felt necessary to say that somewhere.

### Celeste

I haven't _really_ gotten to play Celeste this year: I moved all my good
hardware to a new setup (the KVM thing I mentioned [here][6], some more detail
[here][2]) which nuked the framerate. And, frankly, stress levels have been high
enough that taking on the last berry (Golden of _Farewell_) felt like something
I couldn't commit to.

But seeing [Matt Thorston tweet about it,][9] I installed the [Community
Collab][10] and friends, it's _delightful_. People have done some wild things!
I've only played through all the "Beginner" stages, but it feels fun and fresh
in a way I missed dearly.

I'll follow-up with a post on all the media I've been consuming to avoid
confronting my failures and the creeping fascism/climate wars, there's been a
lot. But wanted to call this one out sooner rather than later üòÑ
