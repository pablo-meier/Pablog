Those who are close to me know that I've been a distracted mess for the past few
months. Life Events have been happening, folks: Karen and I bought a house.

A little more than a year [after moving into Brooklyn][2], we bought here,
in Fort Greene. Karen and I are lucky to work in tech, and specifically at the
companies we've worked at, such that we were able to make a down payment and get
a mortgage.

We're calling the house Cichlidia, and [I've made a little homepage for it.][1]
Like any other fish, keep an eye on it, it's gonna grow!

### Cichlidia?

A cichlid (pronounced "sick-lid") is a broad category of freshwater fish,
extremely popular for aquarium keepers. Of particular note are African cichlids,
which are brilliantly colorful, and often chasing each other around playfully,
in and out of rock formations.

(they're not actually chasing each other _playfully_: they're aggressive and
territorial as all hell. but it looks like they're having fun!)

The vision for Cichlidia is similar: it's got 4 apartments, and while Karen and
I live in one, we're aiming for something like a group house. If you're bored,
you can go to someone else's apartment, with a good chance adventure is
happening _somewhere_ in the house 😎

### So it's full of people you like?!

We're halfway there! It's got us, with our absolutely fantastic roommate, and
some friends in one of the other apartments. We've got tenants in the other two
apartments until November, carrying over a lease from the previous owners.

### The Dream

Starting **next Tuesday, (June 11)**, we'll be hosting _Tuesdays at Cichlidia_, a
weekly evening gathering for anyone who cares to join. We'll have cheese
spreads, jams, and jellies. There'll ostensibly be some event attached (a
viewing of an 80's German movie? a talk on dog training? collective
playwriting?), participation will be optional, and it'll be chill.

The idea is for great folks we know in NY to know they can see us, maybe meet
other people they like, maybe have their brain stimulated. If you don't have a
plan that week, the dream is you can at least count on Cichlidia.

And, me being [back on my bullshit][3], I hope to have some fun with its digital
presence. I want to be `pablo@cichlidia.house`. I'd like to set up [the Discourse
instance][4] such that folks post interesting stuff in NY and check it.

### Community is work

There's a good chance this takes a few revisions! Karen and I are at extremely
young startups that are demanding a lot of our time and energy. This is more
ambitious than anything else like this we've done. But we love the people in our
life and want this greatly, so I'm confident we'll finish this marathon, even
if we have to take breaks. 😛

if it sounds fun and like something you'd like to help us build, reach out!
