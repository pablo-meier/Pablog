I've driven a lot these last few months: first from San Francisco to Austin,
from Austin to Washington DC, a few trips from DC to Philadelphia, and recently
DC to Wooster, Ohio (not having a boss is great for this).

Making these long drives is much easier with a good audiobook. I've listened to
three in their entirety, here are some quick thoughts on them, in the order that
I read them:

### _Bossypants_, by Tina Fey

You've probably heard this is a funny book, and it absolutely is. It's not
written to be a _comedy_ book proper (imagine those old Dave Barry books); she
can't help but be funny and charming while telling stories from her life.

While her stories are interesting and entertaining, the bigger surprise to me
was how refreshing the whole experience was. It's
nice to read someone who's pretty unabashed about their feminism, though I'm
pretty sure she never uses the word, which is a sensible choice since something
stupid happens in many people's brains where it shuts down if you use _that
specific word_. It's also a great (sanitized and painted-by-retrospect, I'll
grant) insight into how comedy and entertainment happens. There was some kind
of pride among many Computer Science students at Brown every time we
"pulled all-nighters" and "totally didn't sleep last night," but these guys
don't know what it can be to put a show together. Most people don't.

It can be frustrating, in the way most writing can be, that you can't talk back
or delve deeper on issues where you feel disagreement. An earlier Pablo might
have been frustrated with the author as I understood their position,
but current Pablo understands that the Commercial Book For The Larger Public
(and profit!) isn't where an intelligent person will expand every subsystem of
a statement or claim, so instead I just get frustrated at publishing. 

Where do I want to delve deeper? Namely, there are hints she's got the Megyn Kelly thing going on. What do I mean
by this? Progressives loved sharing Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly
[taking Eric Erickson and Lou Dobbs to town][1] when they made claims that working mothers
are bad mothers. But except on _that very issue_ which happens to affect her in
very obvious ways, she's never shown much vigilance. She called military-grade
pepper spray ["a food product, essentially,"][2] when it was used on people she
didn't give a damn about. So while I appreciate Kelly using her position to take
down Erickson and Dobbs, I'm not impressed by her track record when it
comes to looking out for others, since it's damn easy to look after yours.

So when I was getting all those good feelings about yes! comedy and the
entertainment industry is a radically different place for women, and yes! society
has insane double standards for male bodies and female bodies, male beauty and
female beauty; I couldn't help but notice the absence of passion and fervor for sides of very
similar debates and conversations that need to happen, and I wondered how much
of that was just a single book covering only so much ground, or whether Fey
herself is able to see and acknowledge the privileges she has.

I'm absolutely not saying Fey is a Terrible Person completely lacking in empathy -- just
that, "reading" it (listening to it on a cross-country drive), there were both
in-depth passages and brief asides on how women simply _being women_
factored into her stories and how they played out (which I loved!), but hardly
anything on, say, race, or age, and how that might factor into it as well.

And I don't need the book to be all things to all people! If she'd just said
"there's a ton I don't know, and don't feel qualified to talk about, but please
consider it and/or be aware of these forces and/or investigate it in your own
time" (or I got the sense of such a sentiment) I'd feel a little more assured.
But when you discuss your dad's racism as "that's not racism, that's
_experience!_ Those kids _were_ coming to steal your bikes!," it makes you wish
we knew more where you were coming from.

It's funny, I mentioned above that if you talk about "women's issues," it's one
thing, but if you mention "feminism," lots of people immediately get defensive. A
similar thing happens if you mention issues with race or how it's talked about:
most people think "OMG I'M NOT A RACIST" and clam up and start getting angry at
_you_. Please understand: I'm not calling Tina Fey a racist or an ageist or
what-have-you. I just felt that as fantastic and refreshing as it was to hear
someone advocate for the woman's side so many life situations, I also noticed
the absence of other subjects that would have strengthened it, in my opinion, if
they'd been present.

But that is the minorest of minor complaints. Overall it's a very fun and
rewarding read, please pick it up yourself and tell me I'm too sensitive :)

### _The Psychopath Test_, by Jon Ronson

<img src="/img/2013/11/psychopath-test.jpg" alt="cover of The Psychopath Test, by Tina Fey" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" />

I might be predisposed to this book because of [my own mental health issues][4],
seeing my sister change [when her brain did][5], [taking a bit of Neuroscience in college][6],
and having been in a great relationship with a brilliant and accomplished
neuroscientist for 2 years. So I'm a bit of a softie when you talk about Brain
Things.

Surprisingly, I loved this book. If it were a dry treatment of what we know about
psychopathy, I still would have enjoyed it, but it wasn't that: it's composed of
a huge number of interesting stories and anecdotes, giving you an idea of exactly
how little we know about societies, consciousness, what "normal" is, and
capitalism.

The danger of most pop science books is that they're dreadfully boring (see _[Number][7]_),
simplify things to a ridiculous degree such that the end result manages to be patronizing 
_and_ toothless, or trying to make Grand But Simple Narratives that happen to be wrong
(pretty much all Malcolm Gladwell, see the [Igon Value problem][8] or [Why
Malcolm Gladwell Matters (And Why That's Unfortunate)][9]).

Ronson gets around this by not really writing a pop science book in the first
place. This exposes him to the weaknesses of "intrepid journalist" books, and as
a familiar in that territory, he knows how to navigate its obstacles. He inserts
himself in the story, I think, so that we can distrust him and mentally adjust
and audit his accounting too.

Stealing a metaphor from an NPR host (can't remember which), sometimes
documentaries or nonfictions about a single subject are compared to a
microscope, but it may be more apt to think of good ones more like a prism: you
take a single subject and you tease out and reveal the multitudes of themes it
contains. _The Psycopath Test_ does that, since I feel our lack of conversation
and understanding of mental health permeates pretty much everywhere.

(if you end up reading and liking this, consider also _[Mutants: On Genetic
Variety and the Human Body][10]_, by Armand Marie Leroi. It's a similar
story-based treatment of the history of genetic mutations, which I also enjoyed
immensely).

### _Redshirts_, by John Scalzi

<img src="/img/2013/11/redshirts.jpg" alt="cover of Redshirts, by John Scalzi" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;" />

I started following [John Scalzi's blog][11] after he wrote
[my favorite thing I've read on _Atlas Shrugged_][12]. I had no idea he was a sci-fi writer, and
it's not a genre I regularly read, but his blog is entertaining enough, and he always
seemed to take an unequivocal stand on a number of social issues that I frequently
agree with. Examples include
[not attending conferences or conventions without thorough harassment policies][16],
an essay against the idea of ["fake geek girls"](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/07/26/who-gets-to-be-a-geek-anyone-who-wants-to-be/)
(and "fake geeks" in general), an empathetic essay on [being poor][14], and recognizing privilege and
[trying to write constructively about it to people who normally reject it.][15]

Now, being a privileged person fighting for people who don't possess the same
privileges is itself a [very][17] [fraught][18] [topic][19], and I certainly
don't want to seem like I'm fishing for (or trying to shower Scalzi with)
[all those cookies][20]. But when reading articles, I'm comforted when someone
takes the right stance on an issue and seems to know their own limits.

I say all this because part of the reason I ended up "reading" _Redshirts_ on my
drive was because the context has been a lot of fun to watch, especially after
he [won the Best Novel Hugo][21], which has [pissed off][22] [some nerds.][23] I
also knew going in that Wil Wheaton narrated the audiobook, and like I mentioned
in my [depression post][4], he's written something I enjoyed on
[depression][24], and since _Redshirts_ has so much to do with Star Trek, I
thought it'd be fun to hear it read by an actor who was on a Star Trek.

With all that throat-clearing, how was the book? I'm going to have to agree with
[Paul Constant][25] of _The Stranger_: it's not a book I would gush tremendously
over, and if you're expecting High Literature that must contain Amazing Use Of
Ornate Language to be impressive, you're going to be very disappointed. But I
found it very enjoyable -- it's a simple and pop-packaged narrative that ends up
looking surprisingly closely at simple and pop-packaged narratives and their
implications. It ends a little too neatly for my tastes, but maybe that's fine
when the biggest risk of a story employing devices like this is that they almost
never manage to end neatly.

I'll say this: it made my drive to Ohio whizz by. The ride back (without it)
seemed infinitely longer that the way there, so I was very appreciative to have
it. I have a segment of friends who would never enjoy this, and that's their
deal I guess. But if you read this or anything I've linked about it and think
you might like it, I suggest you give it a try.
