    og_description: Commentary/ideas around article I read, tied back a bit to Karen and I after our 4th year together.

Karen and I celebrated 4 years since our first date on Tuesday. 4 years! It was
the Obama administration, and Sapo and I looked like this:

In college I had a phone call with my mom where I was lonely and heartsick, and
she said "it'll happen when you least expect it," to which I said "sure, but
I've been least expecting it for 19 months." Karen came to our first date
after a harrowing legal matter and a string of bad dates with guys in tech; I
was severely distracted because it was the day after Sapo set a fire in my
apartment. I suggested a place that we now agree is the worst bar in New York,
so neither of us was expecting that we were meeting the person who'd so greatly
love, support, challenge, and care for the other. My life is full of blessings
but getting to share my life with someone so kind, brilliant, playful and
gorgeous is the one I'm exceptionally grateful for.

I read some articles and had some thoughts like I do, so here are a few that tie
back to Karen a bit.

### Skincare, faces

Karen is a founder and the CTO of [Ever/Body][1], an aesthetic dermatology
company. We've learned a lot from each other, one of the things I've
learned is _I have skin_ and _it's an organ you can care for._ My parents
forwarded an interview from the author of [_The Park Avenue Face_][3], a book
that details a ton about facial work you can get done. I read it, and if you can
get through the initial (frankly unbearable) advertisement section where he
plugs his own practice, there's a lot of decent instructional material there,
especially if you're a novice like me.

Additionally, Karen tells me about being on a NYC Women at Google mailing list
back when she worked there, and while people were sharing tips, one of them
expressed something like "rather than _fix_ wrinkles, why not prevent them from
ever forming? I've been getting Botox and haven't frowned since I was 21," which
seemed like sound advice.

Lastly, the [ContraPoints video on Beauty][5], while pretty good all-around, has
a few notable sections, like her expansive skincare regimen, and how the few
Manly Men who've gotten into skincare have coded it in camo by calling it
SKINMAXING.

From all these sources, what are some takeaways I'm trying to be mindful of.

- Straight men, get on this, the bar is _so low_ for us and you can get a lot
  from doing very little.

- The main _actually proven effective_ ingredient for preventing aging is
  [Retinol][6], which requires a prescription for the concentrations that
  actually matter (if you buy a product that advertises Retinol without a
  script, it's not useful). Prescriptions are work, but B2C companies like 
  [Apostrophe][4] can make it easier.

- I read [this article about a TikTok skin influencer][2] which had a line I
  liked: "All you really need is SPF, moisturizer, and cleanser, and the best
  brands are at your local drug store." So after Retinol, get those three
  things. Clean the pores, protect from dryness, protect from sun. Don't sweat
  the rest unless you really want to.

- And _with all this said_: Topical-based skincare won't get you results like
  neurotoxin or surgery. That's just a function of what skin is, how
  it's held up by muscle, and how much deeper than "topical" it all goes. To
  take [from the Ever/Body Instagram account][13], which took from a tweet I
  haven't been able to find:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/7/everbody_instagram_THUMB.png" alt="A tweet that was shared on Ever/Body's Instagram account saying &quot;Quit sharing your skin routine and just tell us who did your Botox&quot;" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

Botox can bruise and surgery is risky, and they have different cost profiles
than topical regimens, but the results are much, much stronger.

- Facelifts aren't in the category of "regular work," but keep them in mind!
  They have pretty magical results. If I look _fucking amazing_ at 50, you'll
  know I got one.

Not skin, but kind of relevant: if you like your hair and think you might lose
it, it's **much** easier to preserve the hair you have instead of trying to put
it back (though transplants and hair plugs are apparently far better than they
were in the 90's and aughts? [Ask Elon lol.][12] Don't want to find out). In any
case, Finasteride (Propecia) is also available easily from B2Cs like [hims][7],
though watch out, it might [nuke your sex drive forever][8].

Obviously: "much of beauty culture" and "capitalism" are both independently
horseshit, they combine to produce something nastier, there's a million
ways in which one shouldn't have to play any of these games, and shit's mad
unfair all over. A lot of disclaimers and links from [my first body-shaping
post][11] about humans and their meat vessels apply. But if you can't find the
exit to the unfair game you were born in, it can feel nice to take agency
within it. I'm enjoying caring about aesthetics a little more than I have
previously, but remain cognizant of why it's all a mess.

### Online-ness and dating

I read [this piece on "Media-Thirst guys"][9] and it absolutely _gutted_ me. I'm
sure this would have been me if I were in the dating game longer than I was 4
years ago. A basic description:

> "They aren't bros, but they aren't basic," says Rachel Greenspan, a reporter
> at Insider who recently commented about how many men have referenced their
> love for Naomi Fry on the apps. "They don't work in finance, law or business.
> They're in TV or advertising, something along those lines." 
> 
> Greenspan sent over a screenshot of a Hinge profile that she deemed a "CLASSIC
> example." A man in a turquoise shallow V-neck clasps a cappuccino mug outside
> of an unmistakably Crown Heights-ish bistro. Above, he answered the prompt,
> "What is your love language?" with "Good tweets."

But this is the gut punch (emphasis mine):

> Kaitlyn Tiffany, a staff writer at The Atlantic and one of the few bona fide
> Tinder scholars we have, puts it this way: **These men are enraptured by their
> own self-consciousness, which has never been a suitable replacement for
> self-awareness.** "They stand out simply by way of knowing all the tropes to
> avoid," she says. "They‚Äôve seen the Reductress articles and the viral tweets.
> They‚Äôre not going to make a Future song their anthem, or use a Michael Scott
> joke in the bio, or post a picture of them at Santa-Con."
> 
> When meeting a Media-Thirst Guy for an actual date, the results are either
> charmingly congenial -- a reply guy overjoyed to finally crest the summit --
> or indecently awkward, as all of their freakshow internet thoughts pour out of
> their mouth with disorienting abandon, forcing both parties to reconsider if
> relating to other people in an offline environment is even possible in 2020.
>
> [...] the Media-Thirst Guy practices restraint. [...] they attempt a corny
> Jedi mind trick; peppering the night with enough pointed references to digital
> media until it becomes brutally clear that they harbor some misbegotten
> fascination with the culture and its various heroes and villains.

I don't think I'd have performed the cringey things described in the
article, but the Kaitlyn Tiffany quote speaks to ways where I think I've
grown a bit recently, and am therefore especially ashamed of right now. Today
Pablo is doing things! I'm writing more, I'm loving fitness, I'm reading 
more books, and behind all that: I'm more than a sullen dude in the corner
who's proud of some abstract "being in the know" resulting from being plugged
into a feed of depressing, sardonic takes all the time.

I wouldn't have articulated it like this, but on some level, I felt like it was
simply Being A Responsible Informed Citizen to hear today's way that Republicans
were being racist ghouls, or recognizing specific dogwhistles of the most recent
mutation of aggrieved young men. I carried some sense that this was some
function of social responsibility, _implying that the lack of this knowledge was
irresponsible._ I felt validated if someone could credit me for knowing things,
and more lonely (and therefore, more resentful) if someone didn't know enough of
these things.

Part of why I have some confidence that I wasn't irredeemable on this was, well,
Karen and I continued dating! She's on Facebook, sometimes. She's absolutely
hilarious but doesn't "get" [dril][14]. She doesn't know or care who Bari Weiss
or Bret Stephens or David Books or Kevin Williamson or Tucker Carlson or Bill
Maher are. She's just as informed on the news, it just doesn't involve this
collection of paste-eaters with thesauruses dominating her emotions about it.
She logs off.

Not to go entirely the other way: a _lot_ of great jokes and perspectives
come from Twitter. And when I have dated people who are plugged into the same
stream, it's also a great, very different dynamic. But for a while I was
probably overindexing on that shared bit of culture and to read about how that
can come across in dating got me, man.

The "mosquito in amber" of my dating persona when meeting Karen is present in my
[dating profile][10], which is constructed in such a way I'm sure you can see
elements of all this lol.
