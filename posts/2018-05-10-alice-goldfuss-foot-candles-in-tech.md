    og_description: A favorite thing on tech culture I've read.

The blog has slowed down a bit while working on [my Deconstruct talk,][] but while
you're here, [Alice Goldfuss][1] wrote [a must-read post][2] on different paths to tech,
and where/how to learn different things along the way:

<blockquote>
<p>While knowing about foot-candles added some foundational understanding to my
film degree, it wasnâ€™t required to make films and the lack of it didnâ€™t prevent
you from becoming a photographer in your own right.</p>
<p>Foot-candles are specialized knowledge used by cinematographers and lighting
experts. If you want to go into those or similar fields, awesome, you should
know about foot-candles. But you didnâ€™t need to know them to get as far as you
did.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Being a self-guided programmer means I go through the same mental cycle again
and again. Iâ€™m always comparing myself to traditional CS grads. Iâ€™m always
worried Iâ€™m missing something. Iâ€™m always worried Iâ€™m not enough.</p>
<p>This isnâ€™t helped by some (not all) CS grads holding holier-than-thou
attitudes regarding programmers from non-traditional backgrounds. Nothing like
having your abilities questioned both internally and all across the entire span
of your industry.</p>
</blockquote>

Really, [read the whole thing][2], it won't take that long. It hits a few of the
notes I hit on [my piece about Engineer Showboating and gatekeeping][3]. It also
hits on a lot of why tech interviewing is such a weird, hard problem to get
consensus on.
