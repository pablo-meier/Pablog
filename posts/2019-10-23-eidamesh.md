    og_description: Wrote a few cities in a fictional world for a one-shot tabletop adventure.

<small>🎵 <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EcgruWlXnQ">the Monty on the Run theme</a>, by Ron Hubbard.</em> 🎵</small>

I've [written about the tabletop games I play][1], and a few friends from
California are visiting NYC to play a one-shot adventure. I offered to DM, and
am currently building it out.

I provided details about the setting to aid in character creation, here are the
emails I sent them a few weeks ago to get the juices flowing. I'll publish some
discarded concepts for the adventure itself (a bit like [this post][11]), and
after the game, maybe publish the runbook for it. 🙂

## The world: Eidamesh

(this was also an email, but I won't &lt;blockquote&gt; it lol)

Greetings! Time to introduce our little world!

Our adventurers live in Eidamesh, a few little landmasses surrounded by water
and "there be dragons here" at the edges of the map. While the world is pretty
ancient, it's also still full of secrets: the presence of magic and so many
sentient races mean that history and technology's path through progress isn't
as straightforward as ours. A bit of a [Jeremy Bearimy][5], if you're familiar
with it.

I'll start with some prevalent towns and cities, which might serve to place
your character's background and/or situate their history. Beyond that is the
details on the world more generally.

### Loda

Population: ~400,000.

On the delta of many rivers and near enough the coast for access, Loda's got an
odd mix of "beach town" and "port town" vibes: a lot of mercantile activity
with pretty heavy stakes, many fortunes being made and broken, and a ton of
spycraft. As much of this comes from outsiders from other cities protecting
their interests and hoping to expand their empire as it is native Lodans who
grew up with strong networks and worked their way up.

The beach town vibe is there too, though! Winters run very cold in Eidamesh,
and many creatures near Loda (land and sea) become radically different in
winter than they are in temperate or warm months (think of the fauna in _The
Fifth Season_ adapting to a new Season, or the hostile fauna of _City in the
Middle of the Night_). This has a few consequences for the city and its
operation:

- Mercantile activity goes dramatically down in the Winter because it's much
  higher-risk to operate with more aggressive fauna and weather patterns.

- Winter increases the bargaining power of locals, who understand the
  flora/fauna and have a longer history adapting to the changes.

- Much more celebration and uplifted attitudes during the temperate/warmer
  seasons: "enjoy the sun while it's out."

A few other things make Loda interesting: there's a pretty large pet and animal
culture in play. Its history of invasions looks a bit like Ethiopia, or Russia:
resistant to attempts at colonialism due to natural advantage, and how hard it
is to get it to be anything other than what it already is. Local culture
extends this curtesy to the nature that preceded the sentient beings there, and
view it as a tacit partnership: "we'll value you, keep us safe." Native Lodan
wizards have the happiest familiars, and every other town's ambassadors and
diplomats take on an animal when they settle down there.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Coasts of Australia / Great Barrier Reef.
  - Carribbean nations.
  - Nasty fauna from wherever you like.
- Loda produces a lot of:
  - Fisherman, divers, swimmers, smugglers, fences, spies, spelunkers, translators.

### Clohelm

Population: ~650,000.

To live in Clohelm is to live close to God. Well, one of them, anyway.

Clohelm is believed to be the fountain of life's origin on Eidamesh. A ton of
magic and breaking research on the frontiers of clerical and divine knowledge
has been a part of their history for over a thousand years. It exports clerics,
paladins, and (very quietly…) warlocks at a much higher rate than the other
cities, and almost all visible elements of a culture (the dress, the customs,
interior decoration) stem from service to a deity.

Amazingly, there hasn't been a "winner:" there are 3 main religious
institutions that split up about 60% of the population (each heavily splintered
and with "Reformed" variants), the next 35% or so hold about 12 religious
orders, and the last 5 account for the next 30. There are dominant players for
sure, but enough miracles (and blood spilled over whose was the "true" miracle,
my God…) mean that they mostly co-exist in a stable state. There are,
naturally, political disputes and squabbles and skirmishes (both inter and
intra-religion) but nothing too elevated. Conflict is often centered around
scarcity, and there's no scarcity of belief or divine power in Clohelm.

To use the language of a few cultural scholars, Clohelm is full of many "tight"
cultures ("tight" and "loose" described [here][6]). It's not so important that you
conform to one specific religion's norms, but you whichever you pick, you
conform strongly. As much as anything unites the various people of Clohelm,
it's that you don't fuck around with religion (religions that don't take
themselves too seriously like [Discordianism][7], even when held sincerely, get
stamped out pretty quickly).

Arcane (as opposed to divine) magic presents a bit of a problem for Clohelm,
many believe it to be the aspartame of magic: an inferior substitute for
assholes. Some people make their academic careers hypothesizing that wizards
and sorcerers are accidentally, unconsciously worshipping a deity who never
reveals themselves, and speculate on the provider of that magic. It's a bit
like [becoming a scholar in the exact properties of the invisible clothes the
Emperor is wearing][8].

Fear, strictness, respect, and ceremony are prized in Clohelm. They have the
best hospitals and healers, and their black market serves the most potent and
excruciating poisons and curses.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Saudi
  - The Vatican
  - West Bank (religious affiliations, not the broader political situation).
- Clohelm produces a lot of:
  - Clerics
  - Paladins
  - Warlocks
  - Necromancers

### Kralkukh

Population: ~150,000.

> "We'll do it without you."

Only the bravest (or stupidest) diplomats of the more dominant races (Humans,
Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, or Halflings) become ambassadors to Kralkukh, the
monster race town that is a walled, defended encampment to the Northwest of
Eidamesh's larger continent. Smooth skin, upright posture on two legs, and a
steady gait: pick two.

Founded by The Strong Four, it was a town meant to do things "their way" for
the distressed, hurt, exploited, or underestimated of other cities.
Idealogically, think post-revolution Animal Farm, or Jonestown before, uh…

It's a younger city than most, and like many intentional communities based
around ideas of justice and inclusion for the downtrodden, it had a fair amount
of pain and struggle to get to a steady state, having to do more with less. It
eventually reached relative stability in the last 15 years or so.

Most other governments underestimate it, and Kralkukhians use this to their
advantage. Think Wakanda at the UN: "What can a nation of goat farmers teach
us?" While they're not overpowered to level of Adamantium, they do have a
number of sophisticated inventions: material (stonecraft, light machinery,
access to the underwater world with Triton scientists), cultural (things like
fair voting systems, cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs), and arcane (new
branches of magic, experimentation with portals to other realms).

With that in mind, it's not a utopia: a lot of work is required to keep order,
and it suffers greatly for lack of capital that the other races have hoarded
over centuries. There's also a lot of uncertainty on how it's power structures
will be maintained after the final living member of the Strong Four eventually
perishes; a bit like aging Fidel in Cuba, people just don't know what'll happen
to the state for which their force of personality mattered so much.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Animal Farm, before the pigs went corrupt.
  - Wakanda.
  - Chicano Nationalism, the US Black Separatist movement
- Kralkukh produces a lot of:
  - Scientists
  - Stunning orators and diplomats.
  - Creatures with skills of community organizers, social workers, and activists.
  - Turncoats and scabs who internalize the inferiority narratives and work
    against it (Cipher from _The Matrix_), frauds and opportunists using the
    language of justice.
  - Spies, activists in other cities.

### Sestia / Glory

Population: ~3,000,000.

> "A unified people" / "Tomorrow will be better"

Sestia is one of the oldest and most established cities in Eidamesh, with many
old families having long lineages, and many early fortunes in mining, lumber,
livestock, and agriculture. It often calls itself the bread basket of
the continent, and many of history's best athletes for the continent-wide games
(think Olympics) come from Sestia. While many believe Clohelm is sitting on
some kind of cosmic divinity fountain, the narrative in many people's minds is
that Sestia's farms produce plumper tomatoes, creamier milk, and sheep with
softer wool.

Many of Loda's "foreign empire" presences originated from Sestia, and
the families with established power have slowly tweaked and engineered systems
to be rigged in their favor. As much as "financial engineering" and
sophisticated financial instruments are a thing, they were invented in Sestia.
Important positions were given away nepotistically, leaving a large chunk of the
population in sharecropper-like debt situations.

Many went along with and lived with these pursuits (though it drove many
monsters to Kralkukh in its founding days), until a separatist movement drove the
region in conflict. The Silkworms (so-called to reclaim the "parasite"/"insect"
language the aristocrats assigned them, while highlighting that they do, in
fact, produce what matters) slowly participated in civil disobedience, followed
by uncivil disobedience, followed by violent uprising.  They now consider
themselves a micro-nation seeking recognition, calling it "Glory."

A bit like Taiwan/China, or the Basques in Spain, Sestia refuses to recognize
them, and considers Glory territories as "Sestia with a gang problem." The
conflict is ongoing. Glory is led by a leader named Ladhia, but Dread Pirate
Roberts-style, Sestian authorities have trouble pinning down who or what Ladhia
is, or if they're even exactly one entity.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Monaco, Switzerland.
  - Granada, Spain, when it was a big deal.
- Sestia produces a lot of:
  - Entrepreneurs and laborers.
  - The high western fantasy-equivalent of soil and agriculture scientists.
  - Star athletes.
  - "Prestige factory" establishments (higher education, fancy dog shows).
  - Aristocrats and plucky underdogs; "change from the inside"—types and
    desperate scabs.
  - Cops and folks with a cop-minded mentality.
  - Con artists, art dealers (legitimate and not).

### Rhodica

Population: 8,500,000.

> "She was the greatest there ever was, then… she vanished. She's either dead,
> or in Rhodica"

Nobody really remembers how Rhodica became such a population hotbed: the most
plausible theory is that a major magical event (a long, slow flood? an ice
age?) must have occurred a few thousand years ago, driving all sentient and
adaptable populations to cluster in one area, and confining them there for
several generations. After the event, whoever remained was stationed in what we
now call Rhodica, and all the other towns were founded by frontiering parties
from that remaining survivor settlement. The spark of all life began in
Clohelm, but modern civilizations came from the survivors of that event.

That's just the leading theory, there are others. Regardless, for as long as
anyone remembers, they were born into an Eidamesh where just too many fucking
people lives in this sprawling, clustered metropolis. Organized crime thrives,
political backbiting thrives, pestilence and disease thrive; so too does
cultural pluralism and ridiculous inventions to handle the sheer scale of the
place. Resource preservation and distribution tech is worlds above everyone
else's, and while no government runs smoothly, here it really does provide
services that almost everyone supports and appreciates.

Things happen fast in Rhodica: stores open and close, buildings set up and get
torn down, criminal empires are started and toppled. It's where you have no
privacy but total anonymity.

As a result, if you need something, really, anything, it probably exists in
Rhodica. Good luck finding it, however, especially since many people go there
to not be found in the crowd. Fraud and scams are commonplace.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Hong Kong
  - New York, but, like, twice as dense.
- Rhodica produces a lot of:
  - SENTIENT BEINGS, MY GOD.
  - Cultural mix-and-match. A cafe where you can get milk from a nursing
    Dragonborn? A necklace stringing the adorned bones of halflings? A secret
    society of cannibal elves? You'll find it in Rhodica!

### Landra

> "The most common wish of our patients is to spend their last moments in Landra"
>
> —Elvira, Sestia hospice worker

Population: 250,000.

Landra is a land of arts, aesthetics, and liveliness. In our world, it's the
city Dionysus built. It's both a pilgrimage for bards to visit Landra, and an
occupational hazard, since many of them never leave. Most beings in life want
good health and full bellies; if you can have less of those but demand more of
everything else, you'll feel at home in Landra.

If Sestia is your luxury shopping mall, Rhodica is your `amazon.com`
(everything, of dubious quality), then Landra is your Etsy: regarding trade, the
level of craft and uniqueness of what's being traded is more valuable than the
scarcity of its materials. You can find a +4 broadsword for sale in many cities
for a lot of GP, but in Landra you can find one that makes a screaming ribbit
sound when you strike with it, and to acquire you must trade a contract for
the summoning and labor rights of your non-dominant hand for 3 years.

Landrans are more cooperative than competitive, more collective and individual,
more affective than neutral, and less respectful to authority structures. They
produce way more sorcerers than wizards, more barbarians than fighters.

- Cultural reference points:
  - Argelo from _City in the Middle of the Night_.
  - The gritty artist-friendly New York from the 70's from people's
    imaginations that probably never really existed.
  - Black Rock City, but a whole lot less libertarian.
- Landra produces a lot of:
  - Bards, singers, painters, sculptors, adepts, diviners.
  - Geniuses and muses of every form and discipline; shams and hacks of every
    discipline.
  - A lot of gaunt, skinny people.

## On Eidamesh

While the level of technology is standard fare for Western High Fantasy, most
of these cities are full of surprises around their populations: Sestia, for
example, has effectively learned how to dope their athletes with chemistry,
Kralkukh is extremely advanced in abstract math and political science and have
pulled some pretty amazing materials from the deep with their work with Triton
scientists; and Loda's sailors have been frontiering the oceans and its rumored
they have settlements on lesser-known islands. Rhodica is probably the closest
to outright machinery and what we'd call industrialization, mostly spurred by
the needs of its giant population and the fortunes made servicing it.

## Misc

Between many of these towns are plenty of nomads, wandering bands, minstrel
troupes, diplomats and diplomatic activity, spies and assassins (both
state-backed and private), collectors of rare materials and specialist
knowledge, traveling salespeople, monasteries and shrines. There are forgotten
Gods, archaeologists, and hunters of legendary creatures, refugees, and social
cast-outs. Feel free to pick between these spaces as well as in them 😊


## Global narratives of Eidamesh

There are a few global threads to pull on:

 - As mentioned in Rhodica's origin story, there was an entire other history
   before these towns formed and histories happened, before some giant event
   clustered everyone together. What happened? What lies beneath these cities?
   Is there something there underneath Clohelm, for instance?

- What lies beyond the oceans? Maybe nothing. Or maybe something that found us
  first?

- Psionics aren't really present in this world in any native, established way,
  however, a few arcane experiments have hinted the existence of other planes,
  and a number of scholars are wondering if that's where these "psions" seem to
  come from, beings who can use their mind much like a wizard or a cleric uses
  magic.

- Every town has organized crime. Every town has a secret undead. Every town has
  corrupt leadership, and people who look the other way.

That was the email! I then asked the players to roll a d6, and the mode would
determine where our adventure started. I eventually landed on a few ideas for
the adventure, but I might publish some drafts from the cutting room floor.
