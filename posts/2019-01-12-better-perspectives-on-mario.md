### Rabbi Wario

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Matt's art
is fantastic. Read <a href="https://thenib.com/matt-lubchansky">their comics at The Nib</a>, buy their stuff.</p>

[Eric Thurm][3], in collaboration with [Matt Lubchansky][2], wrote a fun article
[pleading Nintendo to turn Wario into a rabbi:][1]

> But there‚Äôs one glaring problem with Wario‚Äîhe is also an enormous goblin man
> with a trollish nose who loves money. He is, unavoidably, a character out of a
> 19th century newspaper cartoon about the dangers of the Rothschilds or
> whatever other avatar of the globalist Jewish menace.
>
> Yes, it‚Äôs true: Wario is kind of an anti-Semitic caricature.
>
> This is not to say that Wario should be canceled‚Äîhe rules too hard, and is too
> integral to the continued existence of the Mario Tennis and Mario Party
> franchises. There is another solution. Rather than expunging Wario from the
> Mario universe, Nintendo needs to acknowledge the possibility that he can
> reasonably be interpreted as Jewish, accept that as part of his identity, and
> give him some appropriate clothing and activity options in future games. If
> Mario‚Äôs Italian background can be a thread of his decades-long tapestry, there
> is no reason the same cannot be true for Wario‚Äôs‚Äîlikely patrilineal, let‚Äôs be
> honest‚ÄîJewish heritage.
>
> Nintendo has a few options as far as this goes. They could make Wario really
> more of a cultural Jew, and have him go to Shabbos dinner a few times a year and
> light Hanukkah candles with a fire flower. He could be more of a Larry David
> Jew‚Äîan antagonist who is less of an enemy to Mario and more of an annoying guy
> who keeps asking about the proper etiquette around freeing a princess and using
> other people‚Äôs Warp Pipes. But, for me, personally, there is exactly one thing
> Nintendo can do to get me to a point where I am comfortable with Wario‚Äôs clear
> Semitic lineage: make him a rabbi.

> First of all, shut up. This is a good idea.

You should [read the whole thing][1]. The art's pretty rad, too.

### Bowsette

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">"Chompette"
was my favorite Bowsette. This one comes from <a href="https://www.artstation.com/reagan_long">Reagan Long</a>, who you can follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/reagan_long_art">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reagan_long_art">Instagram</a>.</p>

Regarding Nintendo and brand cowardice, they decided to put their foot down and say
[Bowsette is not canon.][4] If you missed this entire story, [here's a great
rundown:][8]

> [...] In September, Nintendo introduced a new power-up item
> into New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe called the Super Crown. The (quite
> innocent) object is used to transform Toadette into a Princess Peach version
> called Peachette - but naturally, this sparked a debate amongst Nintendo fans
> as to how the crown actually worked. Under the assumption it could morph any
> character into its Peach form, cartoonist ayyk92 applied the concept to Mario
> lore - namely, as a way to solve Peach's continued rejection of Bowser. And
> just like that, [Bowsette was born.][9]

People made "bowsettes" for other characters. The top there is of a [chain
chomp][11], and someone made a [Solidette Snake.][10]

### Deconstruction is Sometimes Good

While you're here, let me direct you to one of my favorite internet writings:
[Critical Perspectives on Waluigi][5].


> **I, We, Waluigi: a Post-Modern analysis of Waluigi by Franck Ribery**
>
> Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier.
> Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is a
> reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario ‚Äì the wholesome
> all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi ‚Äì the same thing
> but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario ‚Äì Mario turned septic and
> libertarian ‚Äì then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a
> being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere
> man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no
> reason to exist. Waluigi‚Äôs identity only comes from what and who he isn‚Äôt ‚Äì
> without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a
> world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and
> commerce we are all Waluigi.

The two others are great too!

### Adding political models for fun

A friend of mine [slapped together political dynamics for the Mushroom
Kingdom][6], and it's great. When asked to consider Mario's start as Donkey
Kong's enemy, [it gets better][7]. Click through for the read üòÑ
