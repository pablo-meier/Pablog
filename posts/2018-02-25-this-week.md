I never did write about my Burning Man experience, did I? I had a draft or two,
but I think I'd write it differently now. Maybe later this week.

[One of the people][3] in my camp ([The Phage][2]) sends a weekly list of 5
things he read, thought about, reflected on, or enjoyed, and it's one of the most
lovely things I receive in my inbox. I was thinking of doing a similar thing on
here, especially since I'm hoping to wean off Facebook.

Here are 3 things I loved this week:

---

### On Killmonger in _Black Panther_

I saw Black Panther this weekend and loved it. I was a little sad no one in
my friend group knew [one of my favorite memes.][15] A lot has been written about
this movie and the phenomenon around it, but my favorite was **[The Tragedy of
Erik Killmonger][4]**, by Adam Serwer. Marvel movies [famously have a
problem with their villains,][5] and Erik Killmonger is far and away one of my
favorite _characters_ in a movie in a long time.

### On _Fifty Shades_

I haven't read the _50 Shades_ novels. Based on all the pieces and passages I've
read, I feel all of the following things, at the same time:

* The prose is, uh‚Ä¶ unique ("you haven't lived until you've read prose like
  this", according to Roxane Gay).

* It's a dangerous, inaccurate view of BDSM, written by someone who's never
  practiced such a relationship or done basic research on it. It's akin to
  [Fresco Jesus][8], or [the lion that was stuffed by someone who'd never seen a
  lion before][9].

</div>

* Shaming people for the work they like is a shitty thing to do. Shaming
  artists who put themselves out there and produce is also shitty. We want more
  people creating, not fewer.

* There's a whole history of devaluing art that women like (see: romance
  novels, "chick flicks") and some of the _Fifty Shades_ commentary is
  definitely a bunch of self-serious dudes gleefully hitting that bullseye.

* How this book got produced (as original _Twilight_ fanfic, which [itself
  almost never got published][16]) is one of my favorite "follow your dreams"
  stories.

Anyways, I really enjoyed
<strong><a href="https://theweek.com/articles/754626/fifty-shades-secret-compromises-women">
<em>Fifty Shades</em> and the secret compromises of women</a></strong> by Lili
Loofbourow, doing one of the best jobs I've seen explaining the allure of the books
while treading into real elements of BDSM and Patriarchy.

(Previous favorite on this was **[The trouble with Prince Charming or He who
trespassed against us][7]** by Roxane Gay, where the quote above comes from)

### On SaaS, businesses

[Patrick McKenzie][11] is one of the people who most encouraged me to blog. Not
personally! He's just written many amazing things, and frequently urges folks to
share what they know. It's no exaggeration to say his article [on salary
negotiation][14] changed my life.

He now works at [Stripe][12], and recently published **[The business of SaaS][10]**,
a great high-level overview of SaaS businesses. I think founding companies is
has cultural and institutional gatekeeping such that I'm extremely wary of most
people who found their own companies (they usually lack self-awareness, treat
people as "resources," get high on their own supply, and have [Blowhard
Syndrome][13]); so I appreciate anything about business-building that encourages
others to start companies, especially from someone as kind as Patrick.
