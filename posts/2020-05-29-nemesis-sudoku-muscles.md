I'm happy to announce: I have a nemesis! When I read a lot more Twitter, author
and academic Roxane Gay [frequently wrote about her nemesis without naming
them.][1] I thought it was fun.

I wrote recently about [someone's blog without comments or a contact email that
I wanted to engage with,][2] and this week they wrote a post that was
**garbage!** Like, "your post is bad and you should feel bad!" This wasn't their
first strike, but I was rounding up the other times. This time, they crossed a
line!!!!

Like any good nemesis, most of the anger results from how much we have in
common, and seeing a lot of myself in them: I usually find their posts mildly
interesting, we share a few tech preferences, and they also host their blog with
a custom engine they wrote that nobody will ever care about.

In any case, watch this space! I've got my eyes on you, _nemesis._ Who sucks.
_Slightly._

### Sudoku

In "doesn't suck" news, a video of "Miracle Sudoku" went viral last week, where
someone added a few chess rules to Sudoku, produced a puzzle that had _two_
numbers filled it, and it still produced a unique solution. Many people called
it extremely heartwarming watching the fella work through it:

<iframe width="800" height="450" style="max-width: 95%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKf9aUIxdb4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The week before, I saw [a cute video][4] about how to write a Sudoku solver in
Prolog, and [it was surprisingly brief][5]:

<pre style="background-color: #efefef; font-size: .8em">
sudoku(Rows) :-
        length(Rows, 9),
        maplist(same_length(Rows), Rows),
        append(Rows, Vs), Vs ins 1..9,
        maplist(all_distinct, Rows),
        transpose(Rows, Columns),
        maplist(all_distinct, Columns),
        Rows = [As,Bs,Cs,Ds,Es,Fs,Gs,Hs,Is],
        blocks(As, Bs, Cs),
        blocks(Ds, Es, Fs),
        blocks(Gs, Hs, Is).

blocks([], [], []).
blocks([N1,N2,N3|Ns1], [N4,N5,N6|Ns2], [N7,N8,N9|Ns3]) :-
        all_distinct([N1,N2,N3,N4,N5,N6,N7,N8,N9]),
        blocks(Ns1, Ns2, Ns3).
</pre>

So seeing that video, I tried to encode the new restrictions to solve this
Miracle Sudoku. I got a half hour into it, hit a bug, then realized I was
distracting myself from doing more pressing tasks, so had to put it down. But
Benjamin Congdon, a Good Man With A Blog, [wrote a solution himself][6]! I
appreciate Ben, [his blogroll][18] is fantastically curated, and selfishly, he
[shouted me out][7] at the start of the quarantine.

(not to be confused with another Friend Of The Blog Ben Hutchinson, who wrote
[some][8] [delightful][9] [comments][10] and responded to [a Twitter challenge
with gusto][11]).

And yet! If you're _not done_ with novelty Sudoku, give a gander to ["Ocarina of
Time" Sudoku][3], which mixes Sudoku with some Zelda themes and twists.

### New workout

I've lamented about how lockdown has prevented me from going to the gym, a fine
way to stave off depression (["I have to get huge, I have to stay
huge. Built mass, and build bulk"][12]). Really, you'd think I was more cut for
how much I've whined about it ðŸ˜….

Taking a line from a novel I loved (_A Gentleman in Moscow_), "If a man does
not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them," I quit my
bellyaching and am committing harder to keeping my goals in check while
locked up. This roadblock is clearable, I just have to push through the comfort
of habit (which isn't nothing, to be fair to myself). So I did a bit of research
over the long weekend, also watching a ton of YouTube videos for bodyweight
exercises. Before, I was hacking together my own mini-program, sticking to it
only half-heartedly, but I wasn't doing [push-ups like this][14], or [pull-ups
like this][13]. I went to [a pretty vetted routine][15], and [made a
spreadsheet][16] with slots for the first 4 weeks. I invite anyone to duplicate
it and give it a shot with me!  I'm bad at it, but I figure if I can put in the
hours, it'll become "just a thing I do" before I know it.

A few thoughts:

- Yo these bodyweight people are _taut._ Like [my friend in standup][17] says in
  one of his jokes, it's like when you pet a cat too hard.

- You do, in fact, get sore as fuck if you do these movements right. I was doing
  25 shitty pushups in a set before, now I'm doing, like, 8 and totally feeling
  it.

- Nothing makes you realize how NY apartments make you live like asking "do I
  have regular chairs (dips) or a dinner table (rows)? Nope."

- The dog has come to licking me when I'm holding planks. These are the best
  planks ever.
