    Title: Salary, compensation, and tech labor.

Today on Twitter is [#talkpay][1], where we do what's common in many countries
(but taboo here) and talk openly about our salary experiences. While I'll tweet
my numbers, here are some other thoughts on salaries, tech, and pay.

(More about #talkpay [here][5])

First, if there's anything you take away from reading this, do read [Patrick
McKenzie's fabulous piece on salary negotiation][4]. Following its advice
halfheartedly increased my pay 30% between gigs. It's long, but valuable, do
give it a look.

Note that effective negotiation is much easier if you look like me: a tall, cis,
straight, White, thin man who speaks without an accent and the trappings of
expensive education. People are programmed to just Take Me Seriously. Remember
what happened when [Jill Abramson _leaned in_][13]. She, like many women, was
called bossy and abrasive, whereas [dudes rarely get called those things][14].
Racial minorities can tell you of a long history of getting called angry, uppity,
or bossy. If you're in a position of hiring, please understand that many people
who often get underpaid are punished if they try to remedy this. If you're the
one negotiating, know what's working against you.

Practical advice out of the way, let's talk about payment, work, wages, and the
like.

One, as an employee, **most companies are not your friends, and will not look
out for your interests.** Remember [when Google asked a competitor permission to
make someone an offer over several months][2] rather than, you know, just making
them an offer and letting market forces work? Remember when a bunch of companies
[colluded to drive down wages?][3]

Smaller companies will exploit you as hard or harder. [jwz tells it like it
is][17]. If someone tells you you should be 'excited' to work for them and
accept less money, they're full of shit and want to get fabulously wealthy on
your back. Being excited about an opportunity is not mutually exclusive from
knowing your worth and expecting to be paid accordingly. [Learn to read what job
ads are actually saying][18].

On a related note: these are the same people insisting there's a talent shortage.
Talent shortage!  There aren't enough devs for what we want to do! Well…

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to buy
100 steaks for $100, went to the store &amp; couldn&#39;t do it. We have a steak
shortage! - <a href="https://twitter.com/EffingData">@EffingData</a> on
ridiculous hiring reqs.</p>&mdash; Chiu-Ki Chan (@chiuki) <a

2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The fact is, they just don't want to pay anything approaching the economic value
we provide. That's not an indication of a shortage, just that they don't want to
pony up. I want a Tesla! But I can only pay $200! Tesla shortage?!

No, I just can't afford it. Similarly, maybe pursuing silly-ass boondoggles like
[Secret][6] or [Dufl][7] shouldn't be as cheap? Maybe VC's would have some
limit on the businesses they choose to fund if they reflected their true cost?

The biggest reason I have trouble entertaining notions of talent
shortage is that there's plenty of talent much of the industry ignores, steps
on, or refuses to listen to. For example, how much more talent would we have if
[women didn't leave the tech industry at twice the rate men do?][8] How much
more talent would you have if you hired [at more than half the rate that we
produce Black and Hispanic graduates?][9]

There are many, many reasons why those gaps exist, but people get mad defensive
if you suggest we collectively allow, participate, and endorse a shitty
culture. [Reminder that you don't have to be a racist to do harm, or do racist
things.][11] I think believing you are immune to biases/prejudices that are
observed at virtually every level of society, backed by dozens of years of
research consisting of thousands of social-science studies is… a bad bet.
Especially if you have any notion of history (for most underrepresented people,
it's been bad!) combined with any knowledge of wealth and advantages (or lack
thereof) can compound over time (a lot!!), I feel like not accounting for that
knowledge is unwise. 

You don't even need all that Science and/or knowledge of history:
[the people in question][10] tell you repeatedly that they have shitty
experiences. Other things to remember: [women are often rated on performance,
but men on potential.][15] Also remember that, counterintuitively, if you [focus
on "merit" especially hard you may shoot yourself in the foot with your biases
and amplify them.][16] Remember that life is intersectional: [black and hispanic
women make less than white women, who make less than asian women][19]. On
average, if you look like me, you make a dollar. If you look like my mom, you
make .53.

(yes we need to improve the pipeline but if that's all you've got, [that's a
terrible answer][12] that conveniently absolves those of us with power, today,
from making the changes we need.).

There's a lot, lot more to say on this but if I wait till this post is perfect,
I'll never post it. In the end, this rang true for me (there's a whole thread
there, btw, feel free to click the deeplink to read more).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p
lang="en" dir="ltr">So, there you have it. I have so many feels on this topic,
we, as programmers, get paid so much money, but also not enough</p>&mdash;

**SO**. With all that in mind, if you are looking to increase your pay:

* Negotiate, and hard.
* Know what you're up against, do your best to prepare accordingly.
* Employers wield power over their employees, and there's nothing to make them
  be good at it.

If you hire people:

* Be aware of your biases.
* Be aware of the traps the industry falls into, try not to fall into it
  yourself.
* Know that we're all having this conversation, and appreciate when employers
  try to be Good. It's better to be loved than feared.

In either case:

* This, like most things in the world, is fucked. Do what you gotta do to stay
  afloat.
