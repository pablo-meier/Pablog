    og_description: The Outline closed. This sucks. I want interesting outlets to stop dying.

Looks like [The Outline is closing down][3]. That's really too bad‚ÄîI liked their
[Elixir post][4], and I thought their style, while often rightfully clowned on,
did feel pretty fresh. It was often snarky and/or contrarian, but even the worst
examples were at least moderately entertaining. And, like Gawker, you're not
doing anything interesting if you don't go too far every once in a while; you
only find the line by realizing you've crossed it. If you've never crossed it,
you don't really know where it is.

(FWIW, I'd argue the Outline never even crossed it. They were only a little
weird, sometimes)

One of my favorite pieces of the last year is [_The Death of the Rude Press_][1];
it's downright depressing that engaged people writing for other engaged
people that don't take a flattering voice towards the powerful so often dies by
the whims of the powerful. Most of these rich dipshits will tell you to toughen
up but can't take even a little bit of scrutiny or heat. What they absolutely
can't fathom is thinking these people (who aren't as rich as them, you see)
might also possess some intelligence, have distinct interests, and/or have
talents and abilities they don't. I urge you to also read [_The Adults in the
Room_][5] (or, like, look at Jared Kushner lol).

Even if they're not directly involved in killing these outlets with malice
(_Gawker_ and Thiel) or incompetence (most private equity, like _Deadspin_ and
the herb), it's still mad frustrating that survival depends on the whims of the
super-wealthy. The third piece I urge you to read on these topics, it's [this
one by jwz on community, after another SF establishment closed down because its
rich owners got tired of running it.][2]

It's not clear to me how we fix this except, government intervention that looks
like decent antitrust, but the Dem primary showed us that even that avenue is
closed to us (and wouldn't have done much: the courts were the drivers of
20th-century antitrust, and they're currently packed with assholes). Most people
have the memory and attention span of a goldfish, so a quick primer (off the top
of my head, I'm not even researching this): we've watched the journalism
industry bleed over two decades due to the Internet fucking up their bad
business model (hell, they were crying about _blogs_, to give you a sense of how
long this has been happening), [private equity vultures destroying everything
they touch][6] including media, the consolidation [and gross politicization][8]
of local news [via Sinclair broadcasting][7], cable news being cable news, and
social media as a misinformation and radicalization vector. Of course Americans
believe shit like QAnon. Of course Brazilians elected Bolsonaro ([Brazil is
YouTube's second-biggest market!][9]). We're reaping what we've sowed.

(except‚Ä¶ I didn't sow it! I didn't ask for any of this shit but I still gotta
live with it!!!)

Nobody's having a good time right now, but lets wish the best to our friends who
write things professionally. It's never looked good for them, but these are
especially Bad Times, and have been for decades.

Another favorite article about this: [Here‚Äôs a Better Reason to Unsubscribe From
_The New York Times_][10], also by Pareene, on how NYT fits into all of
this (mostly, why it's not great that almost all prestige journalism is
consolidating into one very flawed outlet. Also, Bezos owns the Washington Post!
Murdoch owns the Wall Street Journal! Bloomberg owns Bloomberg!
aaaaaaahhhHHHHHHH).

Also, [_On Smarm_][11].
