I've written up that I play tabletop RPGs with friends, and wrote up some
characters I've developed for them (I wrote up [Homage][1] for [Dungeons &
Dragons][2], [Gorlif][3] for [Mouse Guard][4], and [√Ångel][5] for [Fate][6] as well
as shared some of [the sketches that led to √Ångel][7]). My group is concluding
its Mouse Guard run and bringing in a new Fate campaign in a different setting,
which means ‚Äî new character time! Meet **Ralmahant**, the newest character I
plan on piloting.

### Campaign setting

It helps to know a few relevant details about the setting: 

**Voxxing** is this world's version of spellcasting. The SRD describes it best:

> The vox, as far as anyone can tell, is the divine language of creation. The
> words spoken by some creator god long forgotten that gave shape the world and
> its processes. Across the Divided Kingdoms, there are those blessed with the
> ability to speak this ancient language. Known as 'voxxers,' these privileged
> few can create and reshape reality to their will.
>
> When a voxxer speaks or 'cants' the vox, their words tumble out in a whirl of
> glossolalia and unnatural sound.  Voxxers will generally agree that they aren't
> so much 'choosing' the right words so much as giving sound to a concept or
> visualization of some kind.  These words alter reality, causing fire to blossom,
> water to freeze, or a variety of other phenomena. Each voxxer has a domain or
> 'knack' that they are able to affect. This could be as simple as making fire,
> or the ability to make metal move and flow like water.
> 
> While the act of voxxing itself does not drain the user in any real 'magical'
> way, a voxxer must focus and cant to continue any sort of effect. It's roughly
> akin to being asked to read several dozen pages of text in a language you don't
> actually comprehend as fast as possible, and if you slip up you might explode.

**The Xunvi** are the race of creatures most known for voxing. Their description
most reminds me of the Merchants race from _The Innkeeper Chronicles_, tiny
[Khajit][8] from _The Elder Scrolls_ games, or a little like Rocket Raccoon
from _Guardians of the Galaxy_, all wearing Final Fantasy Black Mage clothing:

> An average Xunvi stands somewhere four-and-a-half feet tall, with the largest
> members of their species peaking at about five feet and change.  Rarely seen
> without voluminous and concealing clothing, they are covered in fine dark
> fur, with glowing yellow eyes and a wide mouth full of small sharp teeth.
>
> Though Xunvi have traditionally worn robes and stoles with a complex pattern of
> sigils and colors denoting their rank, Ostian fashion, particularly hats, have
> crept steadily into their culture.  Mainland Xunvi in particular have neatly
> adopted Ostian dress, with long coats and wide hats always being in fashion.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Hard to find images of widely-known miniature, anthropomorphized land mammals with fur and sharp teeth, so he's a start.</p>
</div>

Their origin country is a magocracy:

> * Planned marriages to increase chance of voxer potential
>
> * Children without voxing aren‚Äôt allowed to inherit land or titles
> 
> ### Government
>
> Think "modern day Italy" ‚Äî blatantly corrupt legislature that ostensibly
> provides regional representation from different provinces, but is merely an
> extension of the elite members of the magocracy
>
> I know this could describe America, but has that certain loony bin 'circus of
> lunatics' feel that has dominated Italian politics for a long time.
> 
> Everyone cheats on their taxes, yadda yadda

"Hundrefolk" get a mention: they're trolls who can vox a bit.

With **all this** now established: here's Ralmahant!

### Backstory

Ralmahant Macad, son of mother Bhimi and father S'therra, is a rare Xunvi
because he's an only child. With four in the litter coming out stillborn, two more
dying in infancy, he grew up with only two siblings: sisters Danali and
Anurzura. Danali was a prodigy voxxer with a knack for stone; unfortunately, she
learned this after petrifying herself in an unsupervised and ambitious voxxing
accident at the age of 10 (Ralmahant the kept the largest pieces of the statue).
Anurzura died in a duel over pride, when they were both 17.

All this to say, even by Xunvi standards, he's always felt a little special. He
wears a ring for every sibling and parent, insisting that their memories (or
spirits) are the source of his voxxing power. When warming up, just as he was
first learning, he often begins by listing their names while touching his rings,
as with a rosary.

His parents didn't react well to the losses of his siblings: S'therra grew
ever more paranoid, insisting political backbiting or foul play was underfoot
(he had no reason to have enemies: he was a court stenographer in a Xun
courthouse); Bhimi devised a new Grand Reason for their misfortunes a few times
a year. Both spent copious sums of money on, frankly, grifters: for S'therra, it
was bribes and "detectives" who could investigate his enemies, for Bhimi it was
geneologists, "doctors," and mystics.

Ultimately, Bhimi's brother Solmabud watched in alarm as the family crumbled
over the next 10 or 12 years. He saw them approaching a breaking point: S'therra
was certain of a conspiracy on the order of QAnon, and was going to "lift the veil"
on the entire ruling class in a way that required procuring several beehives;
Bhimi was arranging her two living children to marry Hundrefolk "for hardier
children who can still Vox." Before they could follow through on any of
these plans, Solmabud arranged a job and living situation for them in Ostia.
They moved when Ralmahant and Anurzura (still living) were 12.

---

Ralmahant, ever a sponge, absorbed his mother's charming mysticism _and_ his
father's self-importance and paranoia. He felt he had room to do
this because his sister Anurzura responded to these traumas by being the
grounded, pragmatic, responsible sibling. The two were closely bonded, and
Ralmahant was the only person Anurzura trusted with her preference for Runology
over Voxing. So it was with great sadness that the family learned she'd died, at
17, in a duel with another student (a human, no less) after school hours.

It didn't help the paranoid family that they weren't given a body ("there
wasn't one to give"), nor were they told what this duel was about. This was the
final trauma from which the Macad clan could not recover, leading to:

- Ralmahant's desire to go into the Scoula Arcanum. He'd learn to be dangerous
  with his voxxing, and he'd chase down the dueler who took his last reasonable
  family.

- S'therra's and Bhimi's deaths: Bhimi, tired of her husband's conspiracies and
  rather fed up with a lack of agency in her family's curses, made an apricot wine
  with copious poison and served it at her last dinner with S'therra. Ralmahant
  came home to find them dead next to their half-eaten dinners.

Ralmahant has now been a student at the Scoula Arcanum for 2 years, and is
currently on sabbatical when an opportunity arises‚Ä¶

#### Adornments

He wears 10 rings for each of his fallen family members:

- The Raw Materials: Bhimi (Mother, left thumb), S'therra (Father, right thumb)
- The Stillborns (middle and ring fingers): Gendi (M), Caburhant (M), Hasslani (M), Pilalya (W)
- The Weak (infant deaths, pinky fingers): Do'amla (W), Girkita (W)
- The Fools (both index fingers): Danali (Voxing petrification), Anurzura (Duel)

He has tongue, septum, and several eyebrow and ear piercings.

He carries a cane, the head of which is adorned with the head of his petrified,
10 year-old sister, mid-scream.

The knack of his voxxing is _dessication,_ thematically tied to death, entropy,
and (dry) decay. At home, there are plentiful maggots, beetles, cicadas, grubs,
slugs, plants, and vines that he frequently voxxes the moisture out of. He
dreams of sculpting crop circles.

### Character sheet

**High Concept:** Scoula Arcanum Xunvi Assassin

**Trouble:** Stability's only purpose is to to lead to more instability

**Aspect:** I'm better than you, you just don't know it yet

**Aspect:** It's not paranoia if you're right!!!

**Aspect:** Death's reluctant jinx.


### Playing Ralmahant

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">The Xunvi take a lot from Final Fantasy's Black Mages</p>
</div>

I'm doing a few things differently here:

I've never played a magic user. _Mouse Guard_ and our other _Fate_
campaign didn't really allow for this, but even in my D&D games I usually
preferred the simplicity of a martial fighter. I look forward to seeing how this
feels!

This is also my first high-status character. Homage was Cantinflas-esque, Gorlif
and √Ångel were attempts at more sincere characters, but like I mentioned in the
"traveling alone" section of [my Asia post][9], centering myself and feeling
entitled to enjoyment is something I still need to work on. Ralmahant
will feel like an asshole to me. He'll strut into rooms (at 4 feet tall) with
swagger and make demands. He's wealthy. I feel like I frequenly lean into
underdog status when I role-play and I won't have that crutch this go-round.

### Inspirations

The big one was [a story I read in the Washington Post way, way back in 2003][10]
(when I was in 10th grade lol) about a man whose entire family had committed
suicide, one-by-one, at various points in his life.

I didn't mean to do this, but reading it over, Ralmahant losing a sister (who's
one of their closest friends) suddenly, pointlessly, and unsatisfyingly has
obvious connections to my life.

S'therra acquiring beehives (and his parents' breakdown, more generally) might be a
bit inspired by the watermelon scene in _Russian Doll._ The mother's "we'll have
them marry trolls" might have a _bit_ of a thread to [those][11]
[experiments][12] they did in the 20th century where a chimp would enter a
family of children as just another sibling.
