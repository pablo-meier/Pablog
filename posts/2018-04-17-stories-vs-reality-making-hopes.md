_The Verge_ has [a great rundown of the One Laptop Per Child][1] initiative that
got a lot of press in the mid-late aughts, with what worked (not much) and what
failed.

> “We really believe we can make literally hundreds of millions of these
> machines available to children around the world,” Negroponte promised. “And
> it’s not just $100. It’s going to go lower.” He hinted that big manufacturing
> and purchasing partners were on the horizon, and demonstrated the laptop’s
> versatile hardware, which could be folded into a chunky e-reader, a simple
> gaming console, or a tiny television.

<p style="font-size:2px;">&nbsp;</p>

> Then, Negroponte and Annan rose for a photo-op with two OLPC laptops, and
> reporters urged them to demonstrate the machines’ distinctive cranks. Annan’s
> crank handle fell off almost immediately. As he quietly reattached it,
> Negroponte managed half a turn before hitting the flat surface of the table. He
> awkwardly raised the laptop a few inches, trying to make space for a full
> rotation. “Maybe afterwards…” he trailed off, before sitting back down to field
> questions from the crowd.

<p style="font-size:2px;">&nbsp;</p>

> The moment was brief, but it perfectly foreshadowed how critics would see One

Working in industry for a decade, I wish I were more surprised: making
shit well, at scale, is _hard_. I've never worked at a company where the sales pitch
reflected the uncertainty of what lay beneath the product within an order of
magnitude (though this may be a consequence of being an engineer with a bias for
reality, working for sales-ey folks who have both indifference to technical
matters and a vested interest in not seeing failure modes).

One red flag from the OLPC story is that it promised to do too
many things at once: mesh networks, crank-powered, custom OS, cheap hardware,
the infrastructure for distribution + delivery, and somehow the context so
children could meaningfully build on these things. You only have [a limited
number of innovation tokens][2], at least at launch.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

There are a few other things that make the OLPC story so compelling to me. One,
**I love the idea of building devices to encourage production instead of 
consumption.** Our operating systems and devices used to be more
hackable: you could open them up with standard screwdrivers, you could replace
parts, they came with interpreters. The trend has moved to locking you into an
ecosystem while simultaneously keeping you out of your device's guts.
Someone once described owning a computer and not learning to program it like
having a fully stocked kitchen but only eating pre-made microwave meals; the
market's response is to sell people kitchens with amazing microwaves but to hide
all the other kitchen equipment. I don't like a future where it's so hard to
build things.<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

The other main thing is that _on a purely technical level_, **OLPC was cashing
in on a kind of utopianism I'd love to see flourish.** I don't mean the "fancy
tech will solve our social problems" utopianism! That's a bunch of horseshit and
I hope we've all learned our lesson. I mean the "we can build Dream Machines
combining 4-5 ambitious technologies for good ends."

Like I mentioned in ["my dream setup"][3], meaningfully better tech
requires us to invest in changing our building blocks: why can't we
collectively invest in a Free Software phone OS that's pleasant to use? Why
can't we have better development tools? I _highly_ recommend [A Whole New
World][4] by Gary Bernhardt (22:10 video) and [Inventing on Principle][5] by
Bret Victor (~54:00 video) for painfully inspiring variations of these themes.
_We should be allowed to want nice things!_

I'd love a durable, creator-centric, mesh network, Free Software,
works-for-children, low-cost computing device. While it's obvious OLPC was
misguided in a number of ways, I'd love to still see us build something like it.

On the theme of "that shit's hard," I went to a talk by my old Programming
Languages professor on [engineering a CS curriculum for children.][6] I found it
inspirational, and gives me the most confidence of anything I've seen for a
vision for computing education. Jane Street put up a recording:

Utopianism is nice, but solving real problems probably doesn't involve
_fantastical gadgets_ you can just plop in front of someone to fix it as its
centerpiece. Education is an established field, and if you're not engaging with
the folks already tackling it there's a good chance you're wasting your time.

There are a few big exceptions here, so few they might be the exceptions that
prove the rule. Main one is the iPhone, but folks like to put on
rose-colored glasses and forget how few features the first version had compared
to what modern smartphones look like, and how many corners they cut.

<span id="footnote2">2.</span> <a href="#place2"><strong>^</strong></a>
Let's make this about Apple again! I can spend ~$700 on an iPhone, but if I want
to run my own code on it I have to pay Apple $99 a year. That's fucked up.
