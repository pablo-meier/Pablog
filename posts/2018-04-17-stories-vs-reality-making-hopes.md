_The Verge_ has [a great rundown of the One Laptop Per Child][1] initiative that
got a lot of press in the mid-late aughts, with what worked and what
failed.

> “We really believe we can make literally hundreds of millions of these
> machines available to children around the world,” Negroponte promised. “And
> it’s not just $100. It’s going to go lower.” He hinted that big manufacturing
> and purchasing partners were on the horizon, and demonstrated the laptop’s
> versatile hardware, which could be folded into a chunky e-reader, a simple
> gaming console, or a tiny television.

<p style="font-size:2px;">&nbsp;</p>

> Then, Negroponte and Annan rose for a photo-op with two OLPC laptops, and

> Negroponte managed half a turn before hitting the flat surface of the table. He
> awkwardly raised the laptop a few inches, trying to make space for a full
> rotation. “Maybe afterwards…” he trailed off, before sitting back down to field

Working in industry for a decade, I wish I were more surprised: making
shit well, at scale, is _hard_. I've never worked at a company where the sales pitch
reflected the true uncertainty of what lay beneath the product (though this may
be a consequence of being an engineer with a bias for reality working for
sales-ey folks who have both indifference to technical matters and a vested
interest in not seeing failure modes).

One red flag from the OLPC story is that it promised to do too
many things at once: mesh networks, custom OS, cheap hardware, the
infrastructure for distribution + delivery, and somehow the context so children
could meaningfully build on these things. You only have [a limited number of
innovation tokens][2], at least at launch.

I remember an old thinkpiece from the late aughts that that argued,
paraphrasing: the reason _The X-Files_ didn't survive the transfer from the Clinton
presidency into the Bush years was because during the Bush years, the thought of
a government competent enough to manage such resources and manpower to a
maintain a conspiracy became farcical. The truth is, getting large
numbers of people to work together to do pretty much _anything_ is extremely
hard.

There are a few other things that make the OLPC story so compelling to me. One,
**I love the idea of building devices to encourage production instead of just
consumption.** Our operating systems and devices used to be more tweakable,
hackable, and accessible, they're being designed purely for consumption now.
Someone once described owning a computer and not learning to program it like
having a fully stocked kitchen but only eating pre-made microwave meals; the
market's response is to sell people mere microwaves, and to make cooking even
harder. I don't like a future where it's so hard to build things.

The other main thing is that **OLPC was cashing in on the kind of utopianism I'd
love to see flourish.** Like I mentioned in ["my dream setup"][3], meaningfully
better software and things we build on it require us to invest in meaningful
change of our building blocks: why can't we collectively invest in a Free
Software phone OS that's pleasant to use? Why can't we have better development
tools? I _highly_ recommend [A Whole New World][4] by Gary Bernhardt (22:10
video) and [Inventing on Principle][5] by Bret Victor (~54:00 video) for
painfully inspiring variations of these themes. _Maybe we can have nice things._

I'd _love_ a durable, creator-centric, mesh network, Free Software,
works-for-children, low-cost computing device. While it's obvious OLPC was
misguided in a few ways, I'd love to still see us build something like it.

On the theme of "that shit's hard," I went to a talk by my old Programming
Languages professor on [CS curriculum design to teach children.][6] I found it
inspirational, and gives me the most confidence of anything I've seen on a
vision for computing education. Jane Street put up a recording:

Utopianism is nice, but if it involves _fantastical gadgets_ as its centerpiece
and ignores the realities of education, it's probably snake oil.
