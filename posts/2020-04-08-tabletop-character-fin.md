I'm in another tabletop game! This one is in the setting of [Cyberpunk 2020][3],
so: "jacking in" to the network to do some "netrunning"! Swords and street
samurai in neon! Body modification and augmentation with tech, like in _Deus
Ex_. A feudalistic/capitalist megalopolis where the government has no
jurisdiction called _Night City_. It's delightful and pulpy.

Meet "Fin," cast in my head as‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ that one's complicated!

## Character intro

John Ferguson never keeps company, nor do the police have any reason to search
his apartment. If they did, it would take a very careful search to find the
button in the wall, behind the garlic salt, that when pressed opens the door to
a cramped basement compartment. Here you can find Alicia Rathbone, Esper,
Eduardo Migadu, and at least 6 others, their faces hanging on the walls, staring
back at you without their host's eyes.

None of them are real, of course: like "John Ferguson" himself, these identities
are (or were once, very specifically) useful to their builder, who goes by many
names (Owo, Hur, Patch, Mist, Stitch, Nova) and is currently using "Fin." Law
enforcement calls it "Ghost."

To the outside, little is known about Fin: how old it is, its sex or
gender, or what its original face looked like. But others _do_ know that
sometime about 10 years ago, Fin started doing jobs with adaptation tech most
didn't believe would be practical in their lifetimes: a full-face implant. Many
on the force still don't believe it and are looking for separate suspects, but
Detective Boris Rabinov has made it something of a pet obsession to hunt it
down.

Back to the face: Through a mix of machine tech, carpentry, 3D printing, and a
pinch of insanity, Fin filed down the cartilage and bone of its own face,
placed studs and connectors at the front of the skull, and is able to construct
masks to fit the enclosure. The studs keep the face in place, and the connectors
send the signal to operate the motors to simulate the 43 "muscles" in place.
Boris is looking for someone with a background in ripping or cosmetic surgery
(or both).

Fin's first jobs were mostly information gathering, espionage, and theft. But
somewhere down the line‚Ä¶ it changed. Fin never revealed its own motives,
sometimes forgetting to collect payment, or turning down a job from a strong
referral of its last clients. But its most common gig of late is assassination.
And there is no "middle-ground" Fin assassination: it's either a "send a
message" gory display of horror and viscera, or a quiet "could have been an
accident." This seems dependent on criteria only Fin knows: its clients now
know not to request one, since it doesn't seem to matter.

## First-person backstory

_Because I have to play this character, I do have to make certain decisions
about how it came about. Here's a shot._

Fin was originally Carlos Orellana, who before that was born Carla Orellana and
assigned female at birth in Madrid. Carlos was the only child of loving and
accepting parents encouraged him in all his hobbies and activities. He took more
to theater than sports, finding solace in acting, dancing and costume design.
His _abuela_ had given him well-intentioned sewing and embroidery lessons when
he was a child, and while he applied them happily to theater costuming, he was
also eager to put his hands to use in woodworking and machine-building.

He got eventually left Spain to matriculate at Yale, where he entered a
fraternity and joined a secret society much like Skull and Bones. There, he met
the primary love interest for the next few years: a young medical student named
Tiberius Ramio. The two spent an obsessively long time together, and their
favorite hobby could only be described as _hijinx._ Carlos would work with
forgers, hackers, and use his machine work to help them run the best pranks Yale
has ever seen. With graduation nearing, Tiberius was offered a job at the FBI,
and he referred Carlos in for his skills in an experimental operations division.
They accepted.

This division was in charge of sneak tech: how to get field agents where they
needed to go. Biometrics and hacks were increasingly becoming common, and the
FBI needed better tools to infiltrate. Their team consisted of 6 people of
various age groups, legal statuses, and disciplines to come up with the very
best in sneak tech. Their boss never revealed a complete name, she just asked to
be referred to as "Mayfly."

The next four years were a blur: drunken nights, wild experiments for all sorts
of prosthetics. He remembers his excitement at his first 3D-printed component,
he never thought he'd end up getting so familiar with it that he'd find bugs
in its designs and be designing its upgrades.

A few of their inventions went out into the field, but there was one project
Tiberius and he always privately came back to: the "Doubtfire" project. What if
you could convincingly change an _entire face_? They speculated as to how, but
even the most plausible way seemed incredibly risky, mentally _and_ physically,
to whoever would undergo it.

One day, Tiberius disappeared. Mayfly's second-in-command, a man named Rune,
told them he was needed in HQ and unavailable for contact. Something felt very,
very off about this, but Carlos knew when he was being blocked. He bade his time
and respected the process, but was growing impatient. Furthermore, every day,
Tiberius's belongings and notes were being confiscated by G-Men. He stole what
he could, but he wanted to get to the bottom of it.

During his panic, Rune takes a walk with Carlos, and informs him: The FBI is
pretty sure Tiberius is a mole. "I'm sorry, the man you loved was a traitor to
organized crime in Night City. The sooner you can let him go, the better."

Carlos had heard of the horrible interrogation techniques they'd had for
suspected traitors. And the possibility of a mole is real, but he could never
believe it was Tiberius. Rune? Mayfly? Someone else from their crew?! But there
was no way out: his official search paths were all blocked, and being a federal
employee, they'd never give him peace in civil society from surveillance. So‚Ä¶ he
tried to move on. He tried, but it was far, far too much. Months of creeping
alcoholism, and the nagging feeling that it was _just impossible_ to lose
everything like this, he started engaging in self-destructive behavior. He saw
enemies where he saw his friends. And he kept fixating on Doubtfire: if he could
make it work, he might be able to "disappear" from the FBI and continue his
search. And being the old theater kid he was, he'd love his and Tiberius's
ideas to be what brought them back together.

This‚Ä¶ was all 15 years ago. It's lost the memory of what finally drew it to do
it. It's likely it repressed the painful, horrifying memories of the
disfigurement. And it knew Tiberius was probably long dead. Wearing enough
faces‚Ä¶ it's forgotten its own. It made a copy, but it refuses to look at it.
It'll only ever wear it to be re-united. Until then, it's building up its nest
egg and contacts, seeking answers the whole time.

## Fin's "workshop"

Wigs, spirit gum, makeup, woodworking, a 3D printer, a work bench, hi-definition
monitors for reference work. Checklists, checklists everywhere: which poses to
try to QA a face.

## Playing Fin

The largest direct inspiration for Fin was _Metal Gear Solid's_ [Decoy
Octopus][6], a character so obsessed with disguising himself convincingly he'd
inject his own veins with the blood of the person he's impersonating. When
considering the Cyberpunk world, I asked the DM how far body mod could go, and
the idea of someone making a full-face implant (and what that would cost) was
alluring.

I've played Fin for two sessions, the third is tonight, and I'm finding it to be
a very successful fit. Whereas [Homage][1] was me playing "along the grain" as a
smartass who deflects with jokes, I've tried recently to play more "normie"
characters. They were fun! But it was a bit harder to tap into them, and I'd
often go back to being _travieso_. To contrast: at this point in Fin's story,
it lives in a state of constant dissociation, except while "playing a
character," in which case it's hyper-focused and more sincere-seeming than the
people who are sincere around it. Feels familiar! üôÉ

I had (and still have) some reservations about playing someone trans when I'm
not trans. If you have feelings about this, please email me, I'd love to hear
them. I'll say that while I'm a man, how I perform it and feel about it is a bit
more flexible than I've expressed publicly. I also think the stakes of
inhabiting someone from a different experience are different when it's
representation in popular media/taking someone else's commercial opportunities
(e.g. Scarlett Johansson and roles of Asians), "playing up" characteristics or
stereotypes to an audience for titillation (blackface at parties, Amanda
Palmer and disability drag), vs. playing a private game with three friends.

Fin fits a lot of other recurring themes in my games: I've always liked Rogues,
back when they were called Thieves in 2E. I've read and re-read [The Complete
Thief's Handbook][5] dozens of times when I was 12 or 13, fantasizing about
adventures my many thief characters could take.

I've also always had a penchant for doppelgangers and shapeshifters; one of my
all-time favorite monsters is the [Greater Doppelganger][4], which eats the
brains of a victim and has all the knowledge, skills, and memory of the creature
it ate. When I was 15 I wrote a character backstory for a campaign about a
character witnessing‚Ä¶ themselves?‚Ä¶ kill a community member, and becoming a
fugitive from that community due because everyone saw him do the murder
(spoiler, it was a doppelganger assassin).

Another Pablo note: I **love** masks. In college, before I settled on CS but was
disatisfied with traditional acting path, I did a lot of research on what it
would take to learn maskmaking under a master. My favorite theater was always
physical, and Commedia Dell'Arte (with their "living sculpture" half-masks and
exaggerated characters) was where I would have dug as hard as possible. There's
a lot I love about my life, but I often wonder what that life would have looked
like.

Last detail of this game: this is the smallest group I've played with in a
while. There's only 3 of us in the party, most of my other games had between 4
and 6. While there are downsides, I'm enjoying the intimacy of it.
