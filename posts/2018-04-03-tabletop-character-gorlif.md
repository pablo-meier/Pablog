I wrote up [Homage][1], my D&D character for the better part of this last year,
but I also had a chance to create a character for a _[Mouse Guard][2]_ campaign.

_Mouse Guard_ is a role-playing game based on the comic book series by David
Peterson. It's a world of anthropomorphized mice in a mouse society:

> In the world of Mouse Guard, mice struggle to live safely and prosper amongst
> harsh conditions and a host of predators. Thus the Mouse Guard was formed:
> more than just soldiers, they are guides for common mice looking to journey
> without confrontation from one village to another.  They see to their duty
> with fearless dedication so that they may not simply exist, but truly live.

The art is beautiful, and I can confirm it's a wonderful campaign setting:

I was aiming for something different than homage, so let me introduce Gorlif:

### Background

Gorlif hated being reprimanded by his parents, Jasper and Clia, but he felt it
was deserved. Once again, against orders, he'd snuck away from his brewing
duties to head to the town watering hole. There were two reasons for this: he
loved the stories of other mice, and hated working on the grain.

It was always the same: the bartender would pretend to believe him when he
claimed that yes, it's okay that I'm here. He'd have a beer and sip slowly,
partially because he wasn't there to get drunk, and partially because it was
often his parent's brew that he'd worked on, and he didn't love being reminded
of his transgressions. Beer details aside, he lived to hear travelers and
passers-by describe and unwind from lives far more interesting than his.

He met Guardmice who'd protected scent barriers, others who'd negotiated grain
deals, one who put down a rebellion, and one with a particularly titillating
tale about finding a remote enclave where mice ate mouse meat because they liked
the way it tasted (that oldfur was probably just telling a scary story, but
Gorlif wanted to believe it regardless).

Turning 13, he and his parents worked out a solution, because despite their
differences, they did love each other: he'd enlist with Mouse Guard. He'd get
the adventure he so craved, and they'd see their son serving a higher purpose
with some discipline in his life. His 2 brothers and sister could continue
brewing, but he had mice to meet.

### Additional notes

Gorlif is a slightly fat blonde mouse from [Shaleburrow.][3] He has a patch
without fur on his left side from a brewery accident when he was a younger.

### Playing Gorlif

Homage hits many of my comfort zones: smartass comments, reckless, fun, chaotic,
and imminently memorable (he's got horns! and solid green eyes and grey skin and
a tail!). Gorlif was my shot at something else: I wanted to play him a little
more "straight:" he isn't _tortured_ or fighting demons, he's a bit of a normie
who enlisted in the Guard because he wanted to be something.

In a way, it's an exercise in empathy: there are a ton of ways that I've felt
othered and different in my own life (either in how folks treated me, or in how
I wanted to see myself), and when I'd meet people like Gorlif the ceiling and
floor of my judgements were pretty low. At best I found them inoffensive, and
at my worst I'd reduce them to a caricature of basicness and blame my unhappiness
on them for not being what I think they should be (things that, conveniently, I
am!).

I recognized that on some level, I'm jealous as hell of people who just contentedly go
about their lives happily, who meet new people with good nature and excitement.
The people I judge are often demonstrating a calm I can only achieve I can now
recognize as healthy and aspirational.

Many RPG characters are some kind of reflection of their creator, and Gorlif is
someone who is happy and comfortable with not being the best at things (he's the
freshest and least immediately capable mouse in our party), who assumes good
intentions in others, and puts his best foot forward. I sometimes can't help
myself and make him a bit clownish or put him on silly adventures (every town
he's in he tries to get people to name their products after him; once we
succeeded and a town has a beer called "Gorlifbrau"), regardless, it's been
tremendous fun.

### Playing Mouse Guard

Mouse Guard is a delightful change of pace from most other RPGs I've played. The
stakes are much higher: these mice are really pretty fragile. While it's
conceivable that Homage can get powerful enough that he can one day punch out a
dragon (weird, really), these mice rarely fight to the death, and most of their
predators can't be killed.

The mechanics are an interesting twist: conflicts encompass more than fights,
and things like persuading a mass of mice in town square, negotiation a
contract, or winning a debating all fall under the "fight system." It lovely,
and allows for more chance than D&D's turn-based system. The stakes are often high,
and the world of mice is adorable.

It all comes together to form a game that's highly creative, collaborative, and
charming. A favorite thing we did: we had to get a quail carrying supplies
across a field without attracting the attention of hawks circling above, so
using some craftmanship skills and some lucky dice rolls, we built a quail
[Ghillie suit][4] and snuck past the field.

I highly recommend Mouse Guard as a game üòÑ
