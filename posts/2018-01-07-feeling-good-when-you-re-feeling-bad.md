Arguably the most impactful thing I've written here (from conversations I've had)
was [when I opened up on depression][1] a few years ago. It's hard work, but I'm
doing a lot better!

I'll share a few thoughts and links on self-care in case anyone likes it.

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

* [Jace Harr][2] uses Twine to [create an interactive Q&A to help you take steps
  to feel better][3]. I haven't played with all the branches, but the times I've
  used it I've always found it to be excellent.

* I liked [this set of approaches][4] that [Alex Vermeer][5] shared. I
  especially appreciate the disclaimer stressing that he's arrived to those
  practices by increments. Don't worry about where the destination is, just try
  to see the next step.

<h3 id="some-practices-of-mine">Some practices of mine</h3>

(note that these aren't available or effective to everybody; it's a big world,
and folks live in lots of different circumstances, I'm just sharing from my
experiences ðŸ™‚)

<h4 id="importance-of-agency">Importance of agency</h4>

This is more of a "theme" than a process, but one of the most central things
I've observed (and subsequently try to be mindful of) is how central 
**agency** is to one's happiness. Succinctly: _what_ is happening isn't
what's raising you up or bringing you down, it's _whether or not you had a say
in it._ This isn't an original thought: I read [_Stumbling on Happiness_][6]
in High School which is an excellent and accessible explanation to this. 

So when I'm looking at why I'm struggling (or trying to model someone else's
troubles), one of my starting places is "What about my situation do I feel is
_imposed_ on me, rather than how I would choose to make it?" Sometimes the
answers to this can be terrifying, but it's almost always rewarding to ask
(sometimes immediately, and sometimes it'll only manifest in the very, very,
very long run. Still: best day to plant a tree was 20 years ago, second-best day
is today).

<h4 id="therapy">Therapy</h4>

Its helped me tremendously. That said, finding a therapist **sucks.** It's
**fucking terrible.** On top of our shit healthcare system, non-transparent
pricing, and delay in evaluating effectiveness, many therapists are simply
terrible at their jobs. Please don't think I'm writing "consider therapy"
believing this is something you can do lightly.

I wish I had advice here, but I really don't: I got introduced to mine via
referral from someone working with my sister [on her recovery][8]. When I
was closest to suicide and living in SF, I called ~30 offices struck out on all
of them. Some of my friends have had success with [Talkspace][9]?
Most health-insurance sites have a "find a physician" portal you can use as
well.

In any case, therapists can be useful if they succeed at setting up a space for
you to safely identify and work through what's blocking you. Be sure to screen
early for whether your therapist is queer-friendly, poly-friendly, and/or
kink-friendly if you feel it'd be useful to work with someone who's conversant
with those issues. Therapists are just people, after all, and might hold many of
the social or structural biases that are putting you in a place to look for a
therapist in the first place.

<h4 id="halt">HALT</h4>

This one was given to me by a boots-on-the-ground therapist I spoke to in 2012,
**_HALT_** which stands for **Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.** The thinking is,
if you feel like shit, ask if any of those is working on you and if there's a
way to address it.

<h4 id="unplugging-log-off">Unplugging, log off</h4>

<blockquote>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m anxious. I just constantly stare at a device that

Like I wrote in [my Open Web post][10], most of how we consume internet is the
information equivalent of only eating fast food. My contemporaries and I have
spent the last decade _perfecting_ how to make your life about looking at ads,
and we've gotten damn good at it. We're not designing these experiences for your
own good, we're doing it to make very rich investors richer.

So, unplugging is great. Recently, [Animal Crossing][7] has helped. Before _AC_
I listened to Jazz or Bluegrass. Novels are great. Try to find that bit of art
such that consumption can chill you out a bit.

<h4 id="minimizing-notifications">Minimizing notifications</h4>

You really won't miss them.

- Turn off the email notification from your phone. It's _supposed_ to be
  asynchronous. Check only once every few hours, when you're sitting in front of
  a computer.

- Unsubscribe _relentlessly_. You don't need a service like Unroll.me, they'll
  sell your inbox data, just Ctrl-F 'Unsubscribe' or 'manage'.

- I turned off Facebook, don't miss it. I'll visit the site most days anyways.
  If you have enough Twitter or Instagram activity, I'd do the same there too.
  In general, if you get a notification, ask yourself "is this something I want
  to keep hearing about?" and decide _right then_ to turn it off, in-app.
