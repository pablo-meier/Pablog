The [Flash Forward][3] book club continues! This month we read [The Light
Brigade][6], by Kameron Hurley. If you'd like to see previous entries, [here's
last month's non-fiction about AI][4], and [the first entry, some fun sci-fi][5].

### Non-spoiler thoughts (at least, no intentional spoilers)

I largely loved it; some people in the book club mentioned having trouble
relating to the main character, but I absolutely did since their prime
motivations were spite and revenge (what powers Pablo? a consistent stream of
self-regenerating bile!).

More charitably, when one has suffered severe trauma, you can cope a lot of
ways; one way is to put yourself in reckless situations and be desperate for a
purpose. This looks a lot like being single-minded about revenge against the the
perpetrators of the trauma that affected you.

War is central to this book; there's a large and rotating ensemble, and a
lot about the bonds of war. In a way, it illustrates that human socialization
and relationships are more flexible and bendable than our need to blow ourselves
up: we'll adjust everything about how we pursue and maintain our relationships
before we decide to put down the guns and refuse to shoot.

One thing I pay attention to in war narratives is how awful they're
presented‚ÄîI read [The Braindead Megaphone][2] years ago, which contained [Mr.
Vonnegut in Sumatra][1], which in turn pointed me to _Slaughterhouse-Five_, and
my favorite thing about it was how it stated upfront that _war fucking sucks._
The first chapter, breaking the fourth wall to just share an anecdote that makes
a point, is something everyone should internalize: stories and narratives about
war and conflict have little bearing to the realities of it, and there's no
redeemable goodness in it. Anyone arguing that there is is likely not properly
accounting for the costs very well, and they've probably got reasons to do this.

I felt a lot of tonal similarities to other stories: the war and jingoism to
the point of parody of _Starship Troopers_ (the movie, not Heinlein). The
whiplash-inducing narrative of _BioShock: Infinite_ and its multiple realities.
_Total Recall_. Some _1984_ and some _Jennifer Government._ The writing is
highly entertaining with a lot of highlighted gems (most of my highlights of
this book were a line or two with a "lol" or "relatable"), and the politics
align closely to mine.

### Spoiler-filled stream of consciousness

I love stories with excellent representation, and it especially amplifies the
strenghts of sci-fi by pointing out how far we would still have to go. I had a
friend who observed that in a lot of sci-fi with alien societies, they may have
gills or lay eggs, but still have two genders, sexual reproduction, and hetero
nuclear family structure (early _Star Trek_ comes to mind). Similarly, we have
_fucking grisly, terrible **war**_ in a world, but it's gender-balanced! It
reminds me of this old tweet (since deleted):

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/6/women_prison_guards.png" alt="Tweet saying &quot;Conservatives: Lets round up Muslims and put them in camps. Liberals: HIRE! MORE! WOMEN! GUARDS!" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

Like, we might achieve better gender parity, but we can't be allowed to stop
there, since we could very plausibly still end up in a futuristic warzone
hell-hole. But, like, with women!

I got some accidental introspection of my biases at the end of the book when I
heard the character's first name. It's also an incredibly touching moment, and
is in strong contrast with the depersonalization/coping I mentioned
above.

Like _City In The Middle Of The Night_, it's fun to see futures where it's
suggested that US hegemony stopped being so singular and dominant, where the
entire rest of the world got a chance to participate in a good story or two.

The interrogation scenes are a tad indulgent and soapboxey. It doesn't really
bother me because, well, I agree with it and live for this shit, but it's a bit
different than the rest of the book.
