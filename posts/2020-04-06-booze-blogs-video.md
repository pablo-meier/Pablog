    og_description: Scared myself a bit by having a few, a few nights in a row.  Blog features. Cyber hangouts.

I mentioned in my "year in review" post that I'd done the last 4-5 months of
2019 abstaining from drinks.

That'sâ€¦ a lot harder during quarantine. I haven't kept it up for a meaningful
amount of time.

Also from that blog post:

> It dawned on me a few times last year that, without trying, I had a drink or a

And, well, it happened again. I looked at the last 5ish days and
realized I'd gotten a little passed buzzed each night. I woke up feeling
like shit, but in the context of a crumbling society, with panic in and outside
the house, incompetent leaders, and a complete lack of agency, when the time
came to "unplug and enjoy the night" it felt pretty good to shut my brain up for
a bit and feel happy in the simple way getting drunk can do for you.

I don't love it, but I'm also not kicking myself about it: we're in uncharted
waters, it was just a few days, and the biggest loser was my sleep cycle. I'm
don't think I'm in troubling territory. But looking at that pattern (moreover,
feeling the continued desire to get drunk again even after those nights) scared
me enough at the prospect of growing a dependence that I'm motivated to stop
again. But in the spirit of sharing how we're all dealing with this, let it be a
data point. These are not the Normal Times. I'll be sipping, idk, tea?  during
virtual happy hours.

### Bloggin'

In this Brave New World of RSS-ing, I've been reading a lot of small-time people
like me with blogs and (I'm assuming) very little readership. It's fantastic!
It reads like people! Writing about things they like and care about!

Kev Quirk wrote a somewhat polarizing post arguing for [blogs having full
posts on their RSS feeds.][5] I happen to agree (you can read a lot of other
opinions on [the lobste.rs thread][6]), but this got me thinking of other blog
features that are to my liking, and sometimes missing.

* Have a way to contact you! I saw one person I wanted to reach out to, and
  their "Get in Touch" in the About page linked their Twitter account and
  Instagram feed. I can't use this! Please, post an email address, or host
  comments somehow. [I recognize that comments are a pain the ass][3] for the
  static sites that are popular with this crowd, but I wanted to chat with the
  person in question and it was a flat dead-end.

* Have an RSS feed! The man, the myth, the legend Robert Mustacchi [blogged
  again recently.][4] His output, when you can find it, is always fantastic,
  ([here's a piece on hardware LEDs talking to the OS][8]). It looks like he's
  using [Asciidoctor][7] (a beautifully laid-out article) and I suspect the
  "blog" is a site generated from an Asciidoctor document. It means there's no
  RSS feed, which means I have to hope I hear about his posts when I cheat and
  log into Twitter every now and then.

Oddly, these omissions are mostly a function of home-baking your own solutions,
which I do and actively encourage. And I'm delighted anyone is hosting words on
the Internet, don't let me or anyone else police you! Lastly, if you have
suggestions for this site and its usability (Dark Mode? Typographically?) please
let me know ðŸ˜„

(looking for people to follow? a lot of [lobsters shared their personal
sites][1], found a bunch of friendly feeds here. I also [shared a ton of
blogs/feeds][2] a few years ago)

### Remote events, lectures

[This post on how a professor runs their lectures to allow for interaction][31]
was interesting to me. "Virtual happy hours" where we look at Zoom's panel view
and hold a drink is popular, but I'm enjoying all the new ways we're adapting to
the remote life.

One detail:

> it allows me to know whom to address, because students register with their
> university credentials and appear in the chat with their full names.

This, of course, is a win and a loss, because then you lose the opportunity for
viewers to troll you the way StarCraft fans did to Artosis in the early GOM
days:

<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic; text-align: center">My Lord we really loved those Grack memes didn't we.</p>

I hosted a Jackbox.tv games night; these do super well on Zoom or Twitch if you
can get the AV + volumes levels right. If you ever want to play, reach out ðŸ˜„
