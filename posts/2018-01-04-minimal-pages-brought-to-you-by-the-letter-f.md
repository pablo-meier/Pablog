New look! [Two][1] [screenshots][2] of the before (and the previous new look was
logged [here][11]).

To prevent this being another boring blog meta page, you should see the pages
that inspired it:

* [Motherfucking website][3].
* [Better motherfucking website][4].
* [Best motherfucking website][5].

There's also [this one][6], for completeness. And for thematic completeness we
should probably include [Programming, Motherfucker][7].<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

There's a point here to be made about the culture of dick-swinging in
engineering, and how it's a natural and unfortunate result of being a
male-dominated field (in that Patriarchy makes anger/aggression some of the
few really socially acceptable emotions men are allowed to express).
I'm a little to busy to make it fully. So while I find it entertaining, let's
recognize that too.

**That said**, if you're interested in some other techniques behind minimal
pages, I loved [this set of tips][8], and [this][9], which it linked to.

Ultimately, I don't feel most of the industry standards are necessary for their
use cases. You probably don't need React. You're not Facebook.

Or use it! But don't feel like you're _behind_ if you're using PHP. After all,
[it's good enough for Slack][10] ðŸ˜„

<span id="footnote1">1.</span> <a href="#place1"><strong>^</strong></a> Outside
of programming, some of my favorite profanity-laced songs are [this song][12],
released during the Catholic abuse scandals making a similar point as [one of my
favorite Onion articles][15].  There's also [this song][13], and [this
remix][14] of Christian Bale's [temper tantrum][16] on the set of Terminator
Salvation.
