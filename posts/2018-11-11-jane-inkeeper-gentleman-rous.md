    og_description: Some things I've watched/read that I loved

### Jane the Virgin, Season 1

Man, TV is great, isn't it? People are fighting over whether the "second Golden
Age of Television" is over or not, but if you're years late to watching the
shows, it doesn't matter, does it?

_Jane the Virgin_ is to telenovelas what _Scream_ is to horror movies: at once
a great example of, a love letter to, and criticism of its genre. There are
unbelievable coincidences, mysterious twins, amnesia subplots, and you are here
for **all of it.** I say over and over again that art should remember a few
things:

* It's supposed to be fun! Or at least, people should be happy they consumed it!
* Your audience knows they're watching something that was built intentionally.

and the best way to sabotage the first bullet point is to forget the second and
make everything self-serious. _Jane_ knows that they're doing.

Well, usually. Season 1 is 22 episodes of 45 minutes each. That's a lot of space
to fill, and in aggregate, you'll go through subplots that fizzle and contribute less
than others. Certain conflicts get contrived. But you forgive it. You've got no
heart in your chest if you don't fall in love with most of the cast several times
a season.

### Rodents of Unusual Size

**20 POUND SWAMP RATS WITH BRIGHT ORANGE TEETH. MILLIONS OF THEM, EATING THE
UNITED STATES COASTLINE.**

There was a special showing of [Rodents of Unusual Size][5] nearby and it became
that diamond in the rough, the reason you still check marketing emails every now
and then. It's a short documentary ostensibly about the invasion of "nutria,"
these 20lb rodents that have decimated coastlines around the world. It's more
properly about the people of Louisiana, resilience, adaptability, incentives,
native vs. invasive, and our realtionship to the environment. It changed my
thinking of fur and meat eating from "almost always bad" to "bad most of the
time but if done conscientiously, maybe even the right thing."

### The Innkeeper Chronicles

Genre fiction! It's been so long!

A rec from a friend, I had a **lot** of fun with [The Innkeeper Chronicles][6], by
Ilona Andrews. While the first is plenty fun on its own, I enjoyed the last two
a whole lot more: there's less need to establish the world, and the conflicts
themselves feel higher-stakes. The first book is plenty fun though!

The most scorching hot take I can offer is _I would have enjoyed high school
(and life more generally) a lot more if I gave myself permission to enjoy work
like this earlier (and more) than, say, Tolkien._ Cultural forces and my choices
within them set me up to be a self-serious person who reads big-L
Literature and required my stories to contain a certain amount of "boringness
fiber" for me to think it was nutritious.

I slogged through _Lord of the Rings_ abroad in a homestay program and had to
labor to stay interested (I wrote that in a 9th grade book report _The
Fellowship of the Ring_ would be better named as _Run, Frodo!  Run!_). Once
you put in the effort to think you've taken away A Weighty Thing from what you've
read, it's easy to enter a Sunk Cost fallacy where you rationalize backwards,
feeling like "_because_ it was hard to chew, it must have been good"

And sometimes it is! I'm ultimately glad I read _The Lord of the Rings_, and
think it's a fine work! But I think a consequence of this (and a lot of other
ingredients) is a gatekeeping culture where genre work gets devalued.
I felt my hackles getting raised at various points and I'm glad I was good
enough to challenge them. I'm happily anticipating the next books in this world.

Once you learn and accept the rules of this universe, it
has an aesthetic that reminds me of why I love _Castlevania_ so damn much (at
the bottom of this post is a recipe for a game I'd love to play based on this).
The cast is a delightful ensemble, the authors are great at keeping
enough balls in the air at a time to keep the pages turning, and a number of the
surprises landed excellently.

There's a fair amount of suburban Americana in here that I'm really charmed by â€”Â e.g. two
women fighting an alien in a Costco with comically large jars of bleach, saving
an alien race with an emergency trip to Wal-Mart, a hot werewolf coming back
from The Home Depot and building a fire pit in the backyard for a barbeque. And
like reading romance novels, I love seeing how art looks when it's structured for
audiences who aren't the New York-living Man-In-A-Vest Reader (Dina, the
protagonist, is literally _a magical caregiver_, frequently pushing aside her
needs to address those of everyone around her, hyper-competent, and can see
petty chauvinistic displays for what they are).

### A Gentleman in Moscow

A rec from my dad. After a slow start, I'm happy to say **its been years since
I've enjoyed a novel this much.** The writing is a bit indulgent but easily
forgiven since it's often legit delightful:

> As if on cue, the door to the back stair opened and in rushed Andrey with a
> pile of oranges about to tumble from his arms. Reaching Emile's side, he bowed
> at the waist and spilled them onto the counter.
>
> With the instincts of convicts who discover the gates of their prison open,
> the individual oranges rolled in every direction to maximize their chances of
> escape.

Structurally, it's a bit reminiscent of _Forrest Gump_ where you follow a
sympathetic character through a world passing through history. In this instance,
the character is a lot more of a draw than Forrest, with the historical bits
taking a backseat. This is a good thing: I'm convinced most
Boomers loved _Forrest Gump_ largely because of the feelings of hearing all
"their music" and nostalgia for being the young, active generation; while this
is structurally similar, I personally find it a more lasting and interesting work.

I loved how it provoked deep questions of the role of personal agency. I've always
felt, as a depressed person, that advice like "you _choose_ to be happy" is
reductive pablum mostly parroted by smooth-brained people who have short
memories (a good investigation of that kind of thing [here][1]); this book is
more of the more delightful challenges to my cynicism and hopelessness.

I'm not often consuming art that says something so true and motivational that
I'm inspired to get it tattooed, but I found it here. It takes a bit before the
book hits its rhythm but I encourage you to stick with it.

The _Innkeeper_ video game would look like:

* 4 side-scroller characters in a game like [Metroidvania][3] or [Mega Man Zero][2]:
  * Dina is the frail-but-powerful spellcaster type.
  * Arland is a tank with slow health regen, hits like a tank.
  * Sean is quick, has fast health regen, hits a little less like a tank.
  * Maud is your "all-around" with light magic powers.

* "Tiny" levels: side-scroller one-off levels for Beast, Helen, or Wing.

* "Ship battle" levels from other games (where you do turn-based puzzles and
  combat), as either Dina, Caldenia, or George. 

* Ace Attorney (or better, [Aviary Attorney][4])-like games for negotiations with Nuan
  Cee.

* Cooking minigame for Orro; if you lose he lets out a Wario-style WAAAAHHHH!!!
