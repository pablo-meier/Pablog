    og_description: DOOM had soundtrack drama. I talk about Jazz and where I picked it up.

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZyyORSHbaE">Many Moons,</a> by Janelle Monae.</em> üéµ</small>

I love when I run `brew update` and it changes around dynamically-linked
libraries, destroying many other binaries and interpreteres in the process!
Sincerily, someone who just had to rebuild [my site generator][4] to relink its
libraries to publish this üòÑ

### Doom, compression in sounds, RSS/YouTube

I wrote a bit about audio effects and compression [the other day][1], and today
I read [an article on _Doom Eternal_'s soundtrack][2], which incorporates 
those topics as well as others around AAA game-making and rights to
artistic work. I found it pretty cool!

Meanwhile, _Doom Eternal_ speedrunning is already broken! Karl Jobst gives
a great explanation on the physics mechanic runners exploited to
effectively fly:

If you're using an RSS reader like I am, I'd recommend subscribing to
specific channels via RSS. Most pages/guides telling you how to do this don't
work (I go to the channel's "About" tab, View Source, then Ctrl-F
"rss" for an `rssUrl`). Watching an old video from a quality channel is
a great lunch break. Some channels I've subscribed to (and their RSS links):

- [Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell][41] ([RSS][42]) ‚Äî cute, well-animated, well-written informational videos.
- [3Blue1Brown][31], ([RSS][32]) ‚Äî math-ey animations and informational videos.
- [Karl Jobst][39] ([RSS][40]) ‚Äî videos on speedrunning achievements and community.
- [Joseph's Machines][33] ([RSS][34]) ‚Äî fun Rube Goldberg machines.
- [Innuendo Studios][35] ([RSS][36]) ‚Äî lefty cultural and political analysis.
- [Carlos Maza][43] ([RSS][44]) ‚Äî the same.
- [Last Week Tonight][37] ([RSS][38]) ‚Äî while many have tried to take their _Daily
  Show_ experience into more newsy late-night (Colbert, Klepper, Bee), John
  Oliver's is probably the only one that YouTubes well and I generally enjoy.

**Please suggest others,** I just started doing this üòÑ Maybe I end up trading
one political hellscape (Twitter) for another and become a person who's brain
gets poisoned by YouTube, we'll see.

### Jazz, again

NPR produced this great little video on Ella Fitzgerald. I think it does a good
job demonstrating why Jazz can be joyful to listen to, whether you've been doing
it for years or are listening for the first time. They center it around a
specific improvisation of Mack the Knife in 1960:

My favorite example of "voice as an instrument" came from Sarah Vaughan's
_Autumn Leaves_:

I wrote about music tastes while growing up a bit in [my boy bands post:][21]

> "counterculture"‚Ä¶ it's Bad!

And for most of middle school, those were my tastes, which are fine enough, but
a few things put me on different paths too:

**My uncle lived with us.** He immigrated here when he was 12 and didn't know
any English when he did; one way my dad helped him with his English was to trace
liner notes from records while the songs played. Martin later did the same to
us, teaching us how to read (I would lie down on his chest and follow his
fingers, shortly after learning the alphabet), so we got a lot of early-90's
rock that was older than the angrier stuff that was targeting The Youth.

**My cousin Bernardo had a high school band, which got Robert to try the 
bass in Middle School.** Robert getting involved in bass started a chain
reaction which would get me into, like, 5 other genres. The first was funk,
which is obviously the coolest shit on the planet. One time we did a holiday at
Hershey Park which calls itself "Chocolate City, USA," and after years of
listening to Parliament let's just say I was sorely disappointed to arrive
there.

The second consequence of Robert's bass-playing was to seek out rock bands with
exceptionally interesting bassists. This is how I got into Primus, which is a
total mess but fun regardless. When I think of Primus, I always think
of [this roast thread on Twitter][22]:

  </a>
</div>

Another unlikely influence: I was in a disco-themed _Twelfth Night_ production
in high school (of all the "memorized Shakespeare" to flex, Malvolio's M.O.A.I.
speech isn't as useful as anything from _Hamlet_ or _MacBeth_ or _Midsummer_
lol); I listened to the playlist our director made for months to teach kids
who weren't alive in the 70's what it sounded like. Disco is criminally
underappreciated, and there's a lot of interesting history on how [hating disco
was a weird proxy for hating people with boots on their necks,][5] echoing a lot
of other cultural movements with no self-awareness.

To bring us back, the other big Robert bass influence was Jazz: Robert loved the
rock bass and my memory was that this was the first thing to really "stick," to
give him purpose. But he knew "being a rock god" wasn't a path he and
his friends were going to take anytime soon, so we looked around and the best
way to Serious The Fuck Up on bass-playing was Jazz programs (idk why we didn't
look at classical more seriously; maybe there were fewer programs? maybe were we
rubes?).

And‚Ä¶ Robert hated it. Tremendously. He came out of his first performance pretty
traumatized, saying "I'm never doing this again." My parents let us quit
things, but not halfway through a commitment: "finish the season," so Robert
(as Meier kids are exceptionally capable of doing) was resigned to just chew
glass while being as good as he could be for months until it ended.

When my parents tell the next part of the story, they make it sound
like I was Making A Very Astute Point. Their telling goes like this: we were
in the kitchen, my parents were sad about how Robert seems to be getting really
down about the Jazz thing, and I said: "Mami and Papi, how can we expect Robert
to appreciate something that we have made so little effort in appreciating
ourselves? If we played more Jazz in the house, we, and he, might come to like
it better." I was‚Ä¶ maybe 11? Or 12?

My memory is different; I mostly pointed out that when Robert became a superfan
of prominent bassists, he came back from Tower Records and subsequently played
_all_ of the Red Hot Chili Peppers stuff in our shared room, all the time. I
enjoyed the hits like _Give It Away_ or _Under the Bridge_, but I used to
hate all the other stuff from their older albums ([_True Men Don't Kill Coyotes_][8]?
[_Fight Like A Brave_][6]? [_Knock Me Down_][7]?!). **But**, crucially, by
playing it all the time, I came to like them. I suggested we play
Jazz around the house not in an act of empathy or _deep insight_ into cultural
appreciation, but a weird form of browbeating and subversion of his tastes, as I
felt had happened with mine.

Regardless, we played more Jazz in the house! And Robert's subsequent gigs
didn't do what the first one did (throw him in a river and say "swim!"); he got
more support and made some friends in his program, and took to the Serious Bass
Life pretty well. With that, he got a lot of jazz albums, and a few years into
it I was bored in Guatemala and gave a Thelonious Monk compilation album a deep
listen, and never heard the same after that.

I'll leave it here. You'll notice that most of üëÜ isn't really, uh, White People
music (except Primus, which was very White). When I got to college I got some
harsh lessons in performative taste-having (as you can see, now I'm an expert)
because while I could speak at length about Jazz, Funk, Disco, Guatemalan Folk,
Bluegrass, Rock, and Electroacoustic music, to a lot of my peers I wasn't
_seriously_ into music, you see, because I didn't have an exasperated positive
reaction to Radiohead, The Decemberists, The Postal Service, Sigur Ros, Bright
Eyes, or Surfjan Stevens, nor did I read or care about Pitchfork. What do each
of those bands look like lol. It was a precursor to the forces that eventually
had me leaving theater and running to Computer Science, which has fewer
pretentions about its ability to shed light on The Human Experience, and pays a
lot better. But that is a much longer story lol.

If you found this interesting, you might like this [odd genre roundup post I did
back before I was blogging more][23], and I definitely encourage you to post
your favorite tunes in the comments üòÑ
