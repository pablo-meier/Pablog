The surgery was a success: they pulled out some sausage skin (he'd gotten into
an encased sausage a few days ago), something we couldn't identify (toy bits?
cartilege?) but the major culprit was a little black rubber ball, which Karen
and I could _not_ identify.

We'll bring him back on Tuesday to get looked at, have a few medications for the
next week or so (antibiotics, anti-nausea), and will be feeding him the blandest
of bland food. Two weeks from now, we go back to get his sutures removed. The
little broseph also has to wear a Cone of Shame until then to prevent him
licking the wounds, but this is worthwhile.

He's a champ and we love him.

(Content Note: gross dog bodily functions)

The second footnote of [the last post][2] had a pretty gross detail of how
Sapo's sickness interacted with our other dog, Rocco. It... got much worse
yesterday. This is Rocco:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

We got back from Sapo's vet visit to find Rocco had opened the fridge. This
happened once before:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

We thought Sapo was behind this: he's the more clever of the two dogs. We
learned the hard way yesterday Rocco was fully capable of doing this himself. He
ate a few cheeses, drank a chicken broth, and some [peanut soup][3] I made.

At 4:30 this morning, the eve on Sapo's surgery, I dreamt that Sapo was on top
of me. I pet him and realized Rocco was on top of me. Then he pooped on me. He
moved to another part of the bed near Karen and pooped there. It was not
entirely solid. We raced to wash, scrub, and replace linens.

**The moral of the story: Dogs are love, dogs are life. Please rescue a dog if
you have it in your heart to do so.**

**But: If it's possible to be talked out of it, consider it!**
