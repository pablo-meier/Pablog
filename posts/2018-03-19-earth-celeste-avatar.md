    og_description: Here are three things I loved and recommend immediately.

<small><em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDVM9KED46Q">Reach for the Summit</a>, by Lena Raine.</em></small>

[Last time][1] I talked about some lectures friends and I listened to as part of
a book club. It dissolved! After one "book"! But it's for the best. I'll make a
better book club! [I'm the man who's going to burn your house down! Using the last
book club!][2]

Here are three things I finished recently that deserve many blog posts. Add your
own faves, or tell me what you thought of them if you've had them too ðŸ˜„

### The Broken Earth

The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin is some of the most enjoyable fiction
I've read in years. Folks who read a lot more sci-fi + fantasy call it the
biggest thing to happen in decades, which I fully believe. I read _Dune,_
_Ender's Game_, Heinlein, and many of the other classics, and none moved me as
much as these have.

Part of the joy of reading/watching things is seeing the story for the first
time, so I usually avoid reading too much ahead of time. While I get that "work
should stand on its own even if you know the spoilers," [learning them in real
time has value too.][5]

If you're someone who needs it before taking the plunge, [NYT][3] and
[Ars Technica][4] have good write-ups.

I'll say the following:

* **What** it is: you can call it either fantasy or sci-fi; it takes the
  elements of both without falling exclusively in the tropes of either.
* You don't need to commit to all three, if it helps you get over the hump, just
  pick up the first (_The Fifth Season_).
* The backbone of storytelling is conflict, and a lot of what differentiates a
  storyteller is how well they craft and describe them. I think the author's
  talent shines most here.
* It gets celebrated for its representation of many groups, which to me makes it
  the world more believable.

### Celeste

[Celeste][6] is a satisfying and heartwarming platformer. The dialogue is
well-written, the art and music are beautiful, and the characters are charming.
One of its central themes is depression and mental health, and it engages with
it in some of the most affirming and relatable ways I've ever seen.

It's got tons of replay value, and does a lot with a little. If you play games,
run, don't walk.

### Avatar: The Last Airbender

I've never felt such a strong need to show something to children before. There are
specific challenges in making things for young minds (usually kids aren't given
enough credit) and conversely, there are many crutches writers use when making
entertainment for adults (leaning on "grit" or violence, generating cheap
conflicts). This beats both sides of this: it has you demand more from
everything else you watch.

The characters are a tight ensemble, each contributing and playing off each
other excellently. The world is familiar enough to be recognizable but different
enough to stage this kind of adventure credibly. It's an endearing world. The
action sequences are well-researched, beautiful examples of martial arts. None
of the fantastical elements distract from the well-constructed conflicts and
resolutions.

Again, I won't go incredibly far into spoilers, and I'll mention it took me
about 3-4 episodes before I fell strongly into it. But it's perfect to wind down
an evening, and there's one character I love so strongly I yell at the screen
every time they make an appearance (I call this "the Appa show").
