    og_description: Video when I played through a game I love

[I mentioned][1] how much I loved _[Celeste][2]_, so I did a playthrough on
Facebook Live. Here's a re-upload:

I'm not great at it, but had fun playing through it again ðŸ˜„. I kept the
cutscenes and dialogue, so folks who haven't played but want to give it a look
can see the story. If you want to see someone absolutely crush it,
gameplay-wise, check out this speedrun which collects all the strawberries:

I'll also note that Facebook Live is a lot more fun to stream on than Twitch if
you're a nobody ðŸ˜› I don't have big dreams of sponsorship or professional
gaming, but if you did, you'd almost certainly play the Twitch game. But if you
just want your friends to check in, the Facebook Live alert is a cute way to do
it.

Obviously, Facebook sucks and makes us all miserable. But I had the rare good
reaction to it when doing this.
