I saw the Tomb Raider movie. I'm probably overestimating exactly how hard it is
to put a good movie together, but it felt like a missed opportunity.

---

I enjoyed the series reboot of the games in 2013: while I don't play new games
very often, I got a free copy of the game with another purchase I'd made. For
AAA schlock (see "correct games" from [this essay][5]), it was a lot of fun! My
brother was a fan of the original PlayStation games, but I found them largely
unplayable (the tank controls, having bad platforming _and_ combat); you know I
can't stand a game if I find [its speedruns][6] boring. The most succinct way to
articulate why I loved the rebooted games was that they cashed the
checks the _Tomb Raider_ series has been writing since its inception: beautiful,
mysterious tombs and a hell of a fun time raiding them.

Additionally, they took one of the most iconic characters in video games 
and improved everything about her too. Lara from the aughts was a weird mix of
male gaze and unaware adventure trope campiness. "You don't shoot with pistols
in each hand!" I'd yell with food flying out my mouth. "You especially can't do
it while jumping a greater distance than your height, laterally while flipping,
several times in a row!" New Lara at least _looks_ like a human, holds a single
pistol with two hands, and jumps like an extremely athletic person instead of
Spider-Man.

Not to say she's free from issues: an executive producer for the 2013 reboot
got into hot water by [saying][1] "When people play Lara, they don't really
project themselves into the character [...] They're more like 'I want to protect
her,'" and I'd argue that shows. They did better in _Rise of the Tomb Raider_
from 2015, but it did feel like the 2013 had more of a "saving her" vibe than
"you are her."

Still, they're fun games. I had hopes for the movie because one thing the games
do exceptionally well is chase sequences. I mean, look at this:

I imagine a building constructed _just like that_ exploding in _just that way_ is
about as impractical [as Black Mesa is laid out to be a research facility][3],
but I figured if the movie was just a ton of that, I'd watch the hell out of it.

So where did the movie go wrong? Well, where it honored the games was bad,
and everywhere it deviated was bad:

The "protect Lara" impulse was quite strong. She has a line where her dad was
saying "[the man who never gives up] died years ago" and she says, defiantly
"well I'm still his daughter!" and runs off. Likeâ€¦ if you give the main
character who carries the series a moment to define herself, _please_
don't [define her as a daughter][2] of someone nobody cares about.

I'll broaden the statement that everything concerning her dad was fluffy and
unnecessary. Nobody cares or has ever cared about Lara Croft on the basis of
whatever "being a Croft" means. Her growth as a character in the newer games is
stronger precisely because she does it entirely on her own.

The games knew where to apply thick layers of schlock and where not to. The
movie has this weird thematic issue with whether or not magic behind the tomb
they're raiding is real; the games just said "fuck it, we're owning it, magic is a
thing because it makes the game more fun." The movie made weaker choices. Ditto
Matthias (the villain) who was the wrong amount of ham.

The callbacks to the game were not well-selected or well-executed. Lara holding
two pistols as the final shot is a silly callback to promo materials of the bad
old days; Croft Manor as a setting could have been made to please fans a whole
lot more with an action or training sequence there ([or locking a butler in a
meat freezer][7]). If a studio can greenlight Shia LeBeouf swinging from vines with the
help of monkeys in _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_, surely
you could have had a campy sequence in there with her fighting some silly
wildlife (both eras of the games has her fighting bears, tigers,
spiders, and once, a T-Rex).

Independent of the source material, the writing was weak, and the structure
tried cramming in a whole lot of irrelevant material. The 2013 game started
with her island shipwreck with the occasional flashback, which would've worked fine
here. They have odd thematic beats, like the repeated insistence that she's
Totally Smart but then you have her delegate all the "numbers business" to an
estranged, clearly-evil aunt.

On that note, the secondary characters were wasted. The actors did pretty well
with what they were given, but they weren't given much. Lara's boxing friends,
the street race crews, the snooty desk clerk, the longing foodservice workerâ€¦
all could have split Dad Croft's or Matthias' lines and it would have been a
better movie. The wealth manager's speaking affect was one of the most ticklish
bits of acting I've seen in years.

Next time: more tombs, more raiding, more traps, more acrobatics, more
[a' splosions][4], more Lara; less "Croft", less half-committed hammy choices,
less telling-not-showing, less winks at aughts-Lara.

I believe it can be done!
