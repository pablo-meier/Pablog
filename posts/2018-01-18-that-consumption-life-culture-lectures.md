_üéµ The song for this PR is [Fight the Power][9], by Public Enemy üéµ_

A few friends and I excitedly started a "book"
club<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>, for which I "read"
[Customs of the World: Using Cultural Intelligence to Adapt, Wherever You
Are][1]. Here are some thoughts on it!

<!-- more -->

There are two primary sections: a description of "cultural dimensions"
(sliding-scale variations you can use to describe cultures in relation to each
other) and "cultural clusters," where he uses the dimensions to describe
related societies.

The "dimensions" lectures are by far the most interesting and valuable part of
the course. To give you a taste, they are:

- Identity: Individualist vs. Collectivist
- Authority: Low vs. High "Power Distance"
- Risk: Low vs. High Uncertainty Avoidance
- Achievement: Cooperative vs. Competitive
- Time: Punctuality vs. Relationships
- Communication: Direct vs. Indirect
- Lifestyle: Being vs. Doing
- Rules: Particularist vs. Universalist
- Expressiveness: Neutral vs. Affective
- Social Norms: Tight vs. Loose

And while they're imperfect tools (lots of overlap, some loose terms, and
quibbles with supporting examples), it gives a pretty good framework for
contextualizing cultural differences we experience. Some reactions I had:

**Causality + fluidity of culture, its adjacents:** I often think of this great
bit of wordplay by Lindy West opening [her review of _Gone Girl_][2]:

> Sometimes I wish I could just watch movies like a fun person, a Cool Girl
> who‚Äôs not too uptight, the kind of someone who paradoxically believes that
> culture doesn‚Äôt influence culture.

And it's true! There's a fair number of people who think A Thing We Call Culture
(movies, porn, violent video games) doesn't meaningfully influence Another Thing
We Call Culture (that big stew we all live in and participate. The deniers of
their connection usually come out when you criticize a thing they like for being
problematic).

It illustrates that "culture," as a word, is a messy abstraction, meaning many
things. This also implies a questionable causality when discussing it in
relation to adjacent things like language, or food: does the culture shape them,
or do they shape the culture?<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

The answer is obviously both, but when Livermore supports his points with
things like languages or architecture or food, you wonder whether he should be
pointing his arguments in the opposite direction, and what that would imply.

**World-building.** One of my best friends observed that many sci-fi
universes containing alien life have _strange customs_, but also preserve
nuclear families and two genders. Most world-building is pretty limited. The
idea of dimensions got me thinking about what _isn't_ a dimension but could be
when building worlds. Suppose someone ends up in a faraway land where the
orientation you face (North/South/East/West) alters the meaning of what you say?
Or where your sexual desirability is determined, in part, by how little oxygen
you consume in aggregate?

Like any knob, there's fun in turning it up as high and low as you can and
seeing what happens.

**Scope in application.** I notice that I place differently on any given
dimension when I'm at work vs. when I'm at home, vs. a different place with
family. I think dimensions like that are fun to consider not just where they
rest but how far they stray when they do, and how often.

The talk on cultural "clusters" is‚Ä¶ well, more tenuous. Here were his lectures
on clusters, see if you spot what I did:

- Anglo cultures (e.g. UK, USA, Australia)
- Nordic European cultures (i.e. Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Sweden)
- Germanic cultures (Germany, Austria, parts of Switzerland)
- Eastern European/Central Asian cultures (Latvia, Russia, Mongolia)
- Latin European cultures (France, Italy, Spain, Portugal)
- Latin American cultures (South America, Caribbean)
- Confucian Asian cultures (China, Koreas, Japan)
- South Asian cultures (Thailand, India, Vietnam, Pakistan)
- Sub-Saharan African cultures (virtually all of Africa)
- Arab cultures (Saudi, Lebanon, Egypt)

Yes, cultures of White People in Europe get 4 lectures entirely to
themselves, 5 if you count Eastern Europe (he lumps in Mongolia and Kazakhstan
in the same cluster, so it feels unfair to call them "exclusively White
European"). Anglo, Germanic, Latin Europe, Nordic. But Africa? Latin
America + Caribbean?  Just one each. I also think it's comical that Mongolia,
Latvia, and Kyrgyzstan all belong to the same level of granularity as _Germany,
Austria, and, like, part of Switzerland I guess._

Snark aside, there are reasons for this: Livermore's Brand‚Ñ¢ is mostly
powering [his consultancy][4], which likely targets primarily White, comparably
wealthy business clients who want to speak to power brokers in other
places. I mean, Jesus, the cheapest offering at the [Offical Place to buy these
lectures][5] is $130 (I did not pay this much). I don't think his core audience
are folks who can't pay. Many of them likely don't feel it as valuable to
invest as much time learning the differences between Ethiopia and Liberia vs.
Italy and Germany (or enjoy confronting why they feel or act on this). Speaking
of‚Ä¶

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They
call them ‚Äúdeveloping countries‚Äù because ‚Äúcountries struggling to recover from
being ruthlessly pillaged and systematically destabilized‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have the same
ring.</p>&mdash; Bunmi Laditan (@HonestToddler) <a href="https://twitter.com/HonestToddler/status/949566815772073984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January

</blockquote>

Ultimately, my issue with these lectures is that **I feel it's irresponsible to
talk about world cultures without more acknowledgement of the horrors and
effects of colonialism.** Which, again, rich and/or White people don't
historically have much interest in interrogating.

I'll focus on the (one) lecture on Latin America and the Caribbean (he actually
never names or mentions the Caribbean lol). He mentions that they are
"particularist" cultures: folks from there use a lot of local and personal
context before deciding to apply rules, rather than applying them universally.
If your friend breaks a law, it's different than if a stranger breaks the law.

I don't know how you can talk about particularism in their culture without
mentioning shit like [decades of civil war or military dictatorship via CIA
intervention][6] or [giving people syphilis][7]. And that's just Guatemala (one
recipient) from selected cases (of many) of US intervention (one perpetrator) in
the last century. So _of course_ you have to limit your trust networks to things
like family, and _of course_ you don't trust government or courts. For
generations those structures were run by corrupt generals _who were put there by
a superpower with guns._

He also mentions that Latinxs have "an optimistic look at the unknown future."
Well yeah it's unknown, most of our history was it getting stolen from us
anytime we tried to reclaim it.

He also gives the Latin America lecture _after_ the Latin Europe lecture,
pointing out similarities and differences. There's pedagogical reason for
comparison, but I don't love that the frame for the colonized always comes after
and in reference to the colonizers, _especially when you don't talk a whole lot
about colonialism._ Just like saying "woman-identified" instead of "woman"
is an often well-intentioned gesture [that ends up being exclusionary][8],
I'd appreciate a bit more thought before folks describe people in reference to
their colonizers when applicable.

In college I saw Carlos Fuentes speak, and he mentioned in the colonial era,
Europeans called Guatemala "the Paris of the Americas," but for some reason
Paris didn't feel the same honor being called "the Guatemala of Europe." üòõ

This isn't to say these lectures are 1000% useless or tone-deaf: there's a lot
to like! But my main takeaway is that this is made for folks who want the
NPR-flavored, power-assauging, conflict-free understanding of "cultures" and how
they interact, and you'll be disappointed if you look for much meatier than that.

[This Twitter thread by Pookleblinky][3] is fabulous and uses food to show some
cool convergences in cooking and food across cultures and history.
