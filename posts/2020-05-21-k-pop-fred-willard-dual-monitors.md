    og_description: K-Pop again, Fred Willard, more of my setup.

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Med2XipHJJM">Catallena</a>, by Orange Caramel.</em> üéµ</small>

I have a cousin who's‚Ä¶ about 15? 16? When she hit the young teen years,
her "thing" was reading genre fiction, but her mid-teen years have been all
about K-Pop. Trying to be the Cool Relatable Family Member, I told her
I enjoyed K-Pop too; we passed a phone around, her showing me BTS and I
showed her [_Mr. Simple_ by Super Junior][1], telling my "joke"
that I planned to do an all-dad tribute band in 10 years or so, doing the
dances ([DOCUMENTATION][2]). This was one of the earliest examples of "you're
not The Youth, You're 30" when she roasted me by trying to be kind,
indifferently saying "it's alright for an older video."

Anyway! I just didn't appreciate the knowledge bomb she dropped on me. According
to [this Vox Explainer][3], all the K-Pop I listened to and internalized was
_second generation,_ and we're now in the _third generation_. So really, I liked
it before it was cool. It seems [I used to be "with it," but then they changed
what "it" was][15], and now what I'm with isn't "it," and "it" is weird and
scary.

Back when he played for compLexity gaming, [Kevin "qxc" Riley][4] wrote a post
on its blog, lost to history, where he listed his favorite K-Pop songs. I [made
a YouTube playlist from that post][5] and it was a go-to from about 2012-2014.
Feel free to give it a listen if you want to get roasted by a teen in the near
future.

(also‚Ä¶¬†why is PSY's [David Letterman impersonator][6] the same dude who [creepily
goes into SISTAR's dressing room][7] ü§î? Maybe this guy is a fixture or
something? idk, I connected those dots once and now you can see it too)

Anyway, your reminder that K-Pop rich and delightfully entertaining. Also, if
you want to turn a critical lens to it üßê there is a **lot** to chew on lol.

### Hey, Wha' Happened?!

[Fred Willard died,][8] which, while a great tragedy for the world, I'm at peace
with. Like Joe Armstrong, I mostly feel grateful for his contributions than
robbed or gutted or anything. He appeared to continue doing cool things into a
golden age without becoming a shitlord, which I always appreciate. Like J.K.
Simmons, he was in a lot of shit and always made it better.

He's not a household name for many, but almost everyone's seen his work. I think
my favorite bit of his was _Wha' Happened?!_, from _A Mighty Wind_, a criminally
under-watched movie:

Anyway, RIP buddy. I'll keep saying "Wha' Happened?!?" and be disappointed that
nobody knows what I'm referencing.

### Back on my bullshit

I upgraded my setup again. We moved the desk, and are _dual-monitor_ now:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/5/standin_desk_THUMB.jpg" alt="Standing desk, two monitors, mess of cables." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

The cables are a mess, and I have a few things left to work out before I start
cleaning them up. I have a KVM switch which _mostly_ works (my PC's graphics
card has only one HDMI out, and it's an HDMI KVM, so my DisplayPort -> HDMI
cable isn't being read properly. It's fine, I've got a workaround).

Previous articles about beefing the setup are [here][11], [here][10], and [here][9].

Subtle improvements:

- Now that my PC is near the router, it's got a wired connection, meaning I can
  stream üòé

- I walked 4 miles to my office this weekend and got aÃ∂ Ã∂bÃ∂uÃ∂nÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂fÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂nÃ∂aÃ∂cÃ∂kÃ∂sÃ∂ my
  noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones back, which makes A LOT OF DIFFERENCE.

Upcoming improvements:

- Hardwire an Ethernet cable for the Mac (though she's running out of ports) for
  even more reliable/fast Internet.

- Maybe start investing in a better mic or lighting setup. idk though.
