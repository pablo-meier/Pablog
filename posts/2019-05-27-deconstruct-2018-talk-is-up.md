My Deconstruct talk is up! I'll see about getting access to hosting it, but you
can see it (and read a transcript) [here ðŸ—£][1].

I wrote some follow-up thoughts with lots of links to external resources
[here ðŸ“•][2]. If you'd like to see the CFP video I submitted for it, it's
[here][5], tell me how well or not I did!

If you were one of the friends or co-workers who helped me workshop thisâ€”thank
you! I feel like this version was more polished and had better slides than the
what you saw, you might like it better this way ðŸ˜„

I also wrote about [the tons of gratitude I feel about the whole experience][3],
and [why Deconstruct is such a fantastic conference][4].
