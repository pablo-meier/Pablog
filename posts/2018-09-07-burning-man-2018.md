    og_description: I went to Burning Man and here's a lot of text and photos.

I just got back from Burning Man. This was my second Burn, I didn't write
extensively about the first. Here are some thoughts and reactions!
üî•ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî•

### On the whole‚Ä¶

I had a great time! The Burn can be a harsh place for couples,<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
and I think this bit Karen and I in my first Burn last year: we had plenty of
great adventures, but we ran into a few differences in planning and executing,
and I think we both felt a lot of pressure to ensure the other had a good time.

This year a few things changed:

* We made a point to have time apart, to have our own solo adventures. We still
  had a lot of great, quality time together, but there were long stretches of
  time when we weren't responsible for each other's happiness, and got to
  explore Black Rock City our own way.

* We've been living together now for the better part of a year, so a lot of bugs
  we ran into previously I now know were a consequence of not knowing each
  other's habits (waking ritual, keeping of a living space, how much/little
  planning to do before committing to action, how hard those commitments are‚Ä¶).

* Another year of therapy and working on myself meant that I'm a little better
  at this "relaxing" thing humans do. I'm more able to "stop and smell the
  roses" and just passively enjoy things, which is a good thing when you're
  trapped in the desert for a week.

I met some amazing people, saw a ton of fantastic art (bunch of photos
[below][11]), connected more strongly with a few friends, and had space to
reflect on my life, and this year specifically.

### Some parts were shit üòÑ

I linked a few articles above about how BM is hard on relationships: it's not
exclusive to romantic ones!

I experienced a few conflicts that I can charitably say _made the sweet parts
taste sweeter._ I got treated disrespectfully by people I trusted and was
told to [harden the fuck up][12] when I expressed pain. [My depression][13]
was brought up to gaslight me and my feelings, and some foundational traumas
resurfaced to a degree I never want to feel again.

I [wrote about trying psychadelics last year and loving it][14]. Substance use
was a part of my Burn and that of my friends. That said, a lot of bad behavior
got excused with "yeah, but I was/they were high." **I don't believe this is a
good excuse.** If you sexually assault someone when you're high, it's not okay.
Similarly, if you're a dick to somebody when you're high, it's not okay. If you
spill a plate of eggs when you're high, it's pretty low-stakes! But you should
still own it, clean it up, and be accountable for it. Getting high is great, and
I wasn't surprised (or particularly bothered) at the amount of ball-dropping by
high people: what bothers me was the lack of accountability for failures, during
and after the fact, especially when people got hurt.

Communities are hard, and I've had to leave a few of them over differing values
in the past. I'm blessed that the community I camped with is chock-full of
great, empathetic, capable, intelligent people. Despite how wonderful my
campmates were, my Burn had some pain in it that I think was the result of
unforced errors.

(this comes with the territory of having human relationships. I'll be fine. If
you do literally anything with people you're invested in, **it'll happen to
you**, as Grampa Simpson says)

### The whole thing is bonkers

I wrote last year

>  It's not easy to get a ticket, it's not easy to go, but if you think there's
>  a path for you to go I think you should consider it.

and I still believe this. There's really nothing quite like it: it's one of the
most creatively-packed, playful, loving environments I've ever been in. If
you can get past the core criticisms around it (which are real, see next
section) you can face literally any direction and see something inviting and
inspiring. There's no "wrong" place to go, and if you have art you'd like to
make, you'll find a home for it there.

If you're interested at all, get in contact with me and I'll give you all the
resources I have üòÑ

### It's worth criticism

Here's a linkdump of articles if you want to hear from people who aren't me:

* [Why the Rich Love Burning Man][2], by Keith Spencer (2015) is often shared.
  It's a bit overwritten for my taste, but has a few good quotes that I like,
  inlcuding: 

> To these young tech workers ‚Äî mostly white, mostly men ‚Äî who flock to the
> festival, Burning Man reinforces and fosters the idea that they can remake the
> world without anyone else‚Äôs input. It‚Äôs a rabid libertarian fantasy. It fluffs
> their egos and tells them that they have the power and right to make society
> for all of us, to determine how things should be.
> 
> This is the dark heart of Burning Man, the reason that high-powered capitalists
> ‚Äî and especially capitalist libertarians ‚Äî love Burning Man so much. It heralds
> their ideal world: one where vague notions of participation replace real
> democracy, and the only form of taxation is self-imposed charity. Recall Whole
> Foods CEO John Mackey‚Äôs [op-ed][23], in the wake of the Obamacare announcement, in
> which he proposed a healthcare system reliant on ‚Äúvoluntary, tax-deductible
> donations.‚Äù
> 
> [...]
> 
> Burning Man foreshadows a future social model that is particularly appealing to
> the wealthy: a libertarian oligarchy, where people of all classes and identities
> coexist, yet social welfare and the commons exist solely on a charitable basis.
> 
> Of course, the wealthy can afford more, both in lodging and in what they ‚Äúbring‚Äù
> to the table: so at Burning Man, those with more money, who can bring more in
> terms of participation, labor and charity, are celebrated more.

* Nick Bilton, in 2014, wrote [A Line Is Drawn in the Desert][22], a pretty
  scathing piece on how Silicon Valley billionaires changed it when they arrived
  in the late-aughts/early 10's.

* [Why Silicon Valley billionaires are obsessed with Burning Man][5], by Gregory
  Ferenstein (2014), is a Vox explainer that is a bit more neutral in tone.

* A rebuttal on the rosy parts of the last piece, [Why Burning Man is not an
  example of a loosely regulated tech utopia][4], by Andrew Leonard (2014). I
  found it persuasive. 

* [Burned out: tech money is harshing Burning Man's anti-capitalist vibe][6], by
  Russell Brandom (2013). A lot of good anecdotes in a short amount of argument.

Jamie Zawinski, someone I appreciate very much, used to go in the early aughts
and has written about and linked a lot of great pieces. He had [gripes with
their branding and photo policy][9] in 2003, and linked an article about [a
Quiznos ad that had some fun with Burning Man culture.][8] in 2015. He also
mockingly linked [a NYTimes article about someone building a luxury camping
vehicle specifically for Burning Man.][3]

#### For my part

It feels a bit too much like a party for privileged people for me to believe too
strongly in the ideals it espouses. To be clear: when it comes to the organizers
or [DPW][18], I don't _at all_ doubt their intentions or their efforts, and
think they do an extraordinary job. I'll also say: parties are great! And if you
and/or your community has resources, you can do great things! I'll finally say
that obviously, a lot of people from different backgrounds (many less privileged
ones) come to Burning Man and make it happen. Even with all that in mind, to me
it still feels a bit too much like a cake that gets labelled nutritionally as a
vegetable.

I loved [this article][19] on how challenging it is to get rich people to
critically examine their role, as obscenely wealthy people, in the systems they
hope to break down with their philanthropy. They clam up and get defensive if
you ask them about harm reduction instead of "good" maximization.  They're happy
to be celebrated philanthropists after they've made their money and built some
rockets for fun, but they're not so happy to look in the mirror if they or their
activities might be implicated in it. I'm just one person, but I would have
liked to see more internal reflection and self-awareness from the folks at
Burning Man on where and how it practices inclusion and exclusion, and how make
its impacts more wholly positive, and lasting outside of playa.

In fairness, I feel this way about almost every community, and I don't have much
hope it'll meaningfully change. [The Master's tools will never dismantle the
Master's house.][20] People love their party too much. From the Jacobin article:

> It doesn‚Äôt seem like Burning Man can ever be salvaged, or taken back from the
> rich power-brokers who‚Äôve come to adore it and now populate its board of
> directors. It became a festival that rich libertarians love because it never
> had a radical critique at its core; and, without any semblance of democracy,
> it could easily be controlled by those with influence, power, and wealth.

My thinking is I'll look for smaller festivals and communities that sound more
like what Burning Man advertises itself as: [this comic][10] on [the Wasteland
Weekend][21] describes a much smaller community of people doing a lot of what's
advertised at Burning Man: living out characters and assuming an alternative
identity, providing experiences, harsh circumstances. It's probably easier to
get closer to authenticity with 4,000 people instead of 70,000 and when your
brand (and its claims of greatness) is smaller and not invaded by tech bros.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.
