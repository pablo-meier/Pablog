You may have seen this video circulating, a demo of the new Unreal engine:

* Jesus.

* I love how it's unofficially-but-obviously Tomb Raider. I played the
  first two games in the reboot series (which led to [me seeing the movie
  lol][4]) and I remember being extremely impressed with how beautiful the game
  was. A lot of hay was made over how [3.4 million copies of a $60 game
  was in the first 4 weeks was "disappointing"][10], and the cost of the engine
  was a big part of that. Wonder what weird contortions AAA will "require" as
  we enter this next phase in game engines.

* I feel pretty blessed that I took the Graphics course in my CS degree. We
  didn't go _super_ deep (barely touch shader programming, for example) but
  writing a raytracer and what makes lighting challenging has been a
  delightful bone for my brain to chew when watching something like this.

On that last note: youth is wasted on the young. I'm never "wishing I could go
back," but it's funny how much information you can gather (that follows you
forever!) in a single semester class, and how much harder it is when you're not
a full-time student receiving dedicated instruction. So many times I've
thought "this is when I'll dig down and write a Minix" or "I'll study machine
learning techniques so I can make it practical in my projects" and I still fail
to get the depth of any of these higher-level classes. I might still! But it is
so much harder lol.

### "Should be intuitive!"

[Nick Heer][1] agrees [with Brent Simmons][2] on the idea that "the ideal iPhone
app first-run experience is none at all," that it should just be intuitive.
There's even Steve Jobs quotes ("iPhone apps should be so easy to use that they
don‚Äôt need Help.") so you Take It Seriously.

Reading in good faith and honoring pedantry: they don't say anything too
challenging. They explicitly specify "iOS apps from the App Store," which is a
pretty broad base of explicitly consumer products, and Nick says many "may not
truly reach the point where users must not need help, but they ought to be
designed with that goal in mind." So what I say next doesn't strictly apply to
these two, but:

This thinking drives me absolutely bonkers. No tool, habit, or product that's
truly useful takes zero training to learn. I dare you to tell me that I should
have dropped this because it's not "intuitive" what to do at this very moment:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/5/vim_screenshot.png" alt="Vim homescreen." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I realize
this might be a self-own, since it's Spanish-localized nvim, so not the iconic
vim homepage effect I was going for, but the point remains: every programming
text editor requires you to think or read a little before you can make good use
of it.</p>
</div>

Think of version control. Think of airline cockpits. If you A/B test an
interface so that it's "intuitive" you'll get software that's only certainly
good at passing that PM's metrics. It'll be the functionality equivalent of [a
late Evony ad][3].

Obviously one shouldn't ship user-hostile software, obviously documentation and
user experience are critically important and should be given a lot of love. But
stopping something as soon as it requires literally any thought at all _then
demoting that thing mentally because you can't be bothered to think_ is exactly
how you get smooth-brains running everything.

(also, remember the converse isn't true: if something is hard to learn, that
doesn't make it "better" either. this is how you get [shitty showboating
rituals][5], and Git)

### Prolog

Would you believe that the page that's gotten the most hits on this blog
is literally [the third post I wrote on it, 11 years ago?][6] I was
so excited to learn Unification and Prolog that I wrote up a post about it,
and I think it shows up somewhere in some search results that it gets a small
number of weekly visitors lol.

Logic programming always scratched an itch for me, but I've never been able to
dedicate the time I'd like to it. I followed a comment thread and found these
old posts from earlier in the decade, on "what killed Prolog," given that it was
pretty hot in the 80s. [This one][7] ties it into the grander computing
narrative of the time; it's really interesting to read a history where there was
an AI "arms race" against Asia for who could do generalizable intelligence
first, a theme with China today [in that often-wrong book I read][8]. The author
suggests that once that "arms race" died for both sides because generalizable
intelligence is hard, Prolog lost its biggest project, never to recover. [A
response post][9] piggybacks on to talk more about the programming model itself.
I don't fully agree with either, but got a lot from reading them.

I think about programming language popularity a lot, and the strongest predictor
I have is the "killer app" model: _almost nothing else about the language matters
except "does it have a killer app"?_ It's a bit cynical, but bear with me: C++
may or may not have offered a lot of things Smalltalk or Lisp didn't in the early
90's, but it was _also_ the only supported way to talk to Windows APIs. In 2008,
people may have really wanted the efficiencies of JavaScript with the memory
safety of C, but I suspect the real reason Objective-C entered the top 10
languages was because it was the only way to build iOS apps. Ditto Ruby, born in
1995, suddenly becoming popular in 2004 (Rails, "look at all the code I'm not
writing."). Elixir would look a lot more like Elm or Clojure if it weren't for
Phoenix.  

I'm not saying the other things most people actually talk about don't matter or
get worked into the narrative, just that it's the most consistent thing I can
find when considering "why are people using this?" Hit me with counterexamples,
the main one I can think of is Rust, where people _really did_ want the
features (a performant, memory-safe language that could viably replace C). They
wanted it so bad some of them called Go a "systems language" for a hot 6 months
before using it for long enough to be like "oh lol, it's got garbage
collection." Go is also a bit of a weird case, I'd chalk that one up to
hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing/evangelism investment.

Anyway, "this is the year we move to OCaml" is my "this is the year of the Linux
desktop!" üòÑ

### Cookin'

I'm still cooking. The novelty has worn off a bit but I'm still finding it
peaceful. I was hungover this morning, feeling antsy and lonely, but feeling
more like a person after putting on some tunes and making eggs, beans, and
coffee.

Last week I made a risotto. That‚Ä¶ was a lot of stirring! I made one back when I
lived in SF; this one seemed to take longer, and while it doesn't look Obviously
Appetizing (most of my food is some flavorful slop), I'm really happy with how
it came out. I'm condemned to make more too, since we have a ton of arborio rice
and bouillon cubes.
