    og_description: A few ideas for my D&D one-shot that I didn't go with.

I wrote [many words about a fictional world][6] for some characters to populate
for a one-shot D&D campaign I ran last weekend. I'll publish the proper
adventure soon but here were some ideas that I had for it that I didn't end up
going with:

### Cast

Here's the whole text document. I'll go over it line-by-line with links and/or
graphics for what I found inspiring about it.

<pre style="font-size: small; background-color: #ececec;">
look at PC backstories for ways to hook them in, but we're after tramps, scamps,
Big Bads, plucky side characters.

Everyone in FANTASTIC BABY by BIGBANG

(your interpretation of) Kefka, FFVI style? Just evil, just because?

Kerrigan (from BW, not SC2) and/or Cersei; mad politics, shrewd.

Jigsaw, from the Saw movies

Zote the Mighty + Dung Defender Capitano-style folk hero of the setting?

a doppelganger who follows the party around

a disembodied, talking head

"my cabbages" guy from Avatar

cast from the JRWI adventure (Dendask the Unfortunate, Sothyra the Dragonborn
wizard)

Zarya, or chain-chomp Bowsette (large-armed beefy woman)
</pre>

Let's break this down:

> Everyone in FANTASTIC BABY by BIGBANG

My 16 year-old cousin likes to remind me that my tastes in K-Pop are _dated,
man_ and she's totally right: I only fell into it for the time I was also
watching a lot of live StarCraft, so 2011-2013.

But look at this music video! There are some _lerks_ being served here. You
could do well by taking any of these costumes or set pieces and building around
that.

> (your interpretation of) Kefka, FFVI style? Just evil, just because?

A lot of this sheet was more imaginative before _certain properties_ had
re-releases, and one of those is _Joker._ Boo _Joker_ for making me seem like
this guy:

<img src="/img/2019/11/auckerman_tweet_THUMB.png" alt="Auckerman tweet &quot;&quot;." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

But yeah, before we collectively directed our confused masculinity at the Batman
clown, we had [_this_ clown][7], who poisoned a water supply just for the hell
of it.  I considered making my Big Bad some kind of sociopath like this, but I
decided against it, I don't think it'd work as anything but shallow in a
one-shot.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/kefka_THUMB.jpg" alt="Kefka looking glorious." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

> Kerrigan (from BW, not SC2) and/or Cersei; mad politics, shrewd.

The original _StarCraft: Brood War_ had a fantastic campaign where almost
everyone was cruel, blinded by ambition, and sending people to a hellish war to
satisfy their own urges for power while an existential threat loomed. Kerrigan
in particular, like Cersei in _Game of Thrones_, was exceptionally strategic,
often underestimated, and eventually took all she wanted.

Again, doesn't work super well in a one-shot, and I didn't know _how_ to
actually realize this character, I was coming from "it felt cool consuming this
story."

(StarCraft II, unfortunately, had an _awful_ campaign, and neutered everything
good about the character).

> Jigsaw, from the Saw movies

_Saw_ movies are dungeon crawls!

Specifically, I liked the idea of feeling targeted, trapped, in mortal danger,
and thoroughly _judged._ In a weird way, this one made the cut.

> Zote the Mighty + Dung Defender Capitano-style folk hero of the setting?

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/zote.png" alt="Zote, slouching as normal lol" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

_Hollow Knight_ has a pretty deep cast and extensive lore, but has a total
cipher of a protagonist, and a lot of flowery language that _alludes_ a ton but
doesn't _explain_ much. I often say that shows that succeed on Broadway can
really only get there if they don't say anything _too_ challenging or commit too
hard, since to "succeed" you need a lot of moneyed people to think it's a good
idea to spend hundreds of dollars on your show, and truly challenging messages
("how are you complicit in White Supremacy?") don't often inspire moneyed people
to fork over their dollars (e.g. what does _Hamilton_ stand for, as a piece? who
does it challenge? exactly).

So _Hollow Knight_ thematically has a similar thing going, where it's certainly
beautiful but it's hard to say it really commits to anything other than its own
aesthetics. That said, its side characters _are fabulous_. Millibelle the Banker
is the best example of banking in a game, and how to "solve" it.

Zote and the Dung Defender are two lovely characters who serve as hero-figures:
Zote is a stuffed shirt who mostly talks himself up, and the Dung Defender has a
fantastic theme song and lovely voice acting. I considered using them as
inspiration for folk heroes of this world, or NPCs.

</div>

> a doppelganger who follows the party around

I always liked the idea of an NPC (or in one case, a party member) being some
kind of spy instead of who they purport to be for the whole time they're known.
Players would spend entire sessions with an NPC before stumbling upon that NPC's
body, while they're still with the party.

> a disembodied, talking head

A bit like "potato GlaDOS," I like the idea of an NPC that they have to carry,
listen to, and protect.

> cast from the JRWI adventure (Dendask the Unfortunate, Sothyra
> the Dragonborn wizard)

The game [Homage][11] is from is colloquially called Just Roll With It, and I'd
written up an adventure that we will, someday, still play. It had a cast I
liked.

D'uh, [he's amazing.][10]

D'uh, muscle women are amazing.

### Setting and Adventure Hooks

Here's the text file:

<pre style="font-size: small; background-color: #ececec;">
## World

"Delaware". Or Attack The Block-style "unlikely places" for an adventure.

Half-Life 2 world of a post quick + decisive invasion. District 9-style
apartheid, but the prawns are in charge.

The dream of a child God. Gotta wake the Wind Fish.

Dungeon in High Fantasy, jump to the far future (subway, guns and shit)

Reality unravel (Celeste Chapter 9, FFVIII time-compressed world)

## Dungeons

Minish cap: shrink into a tiny house dungeon.

Black Mesa/Aperture Science-style slow uncovering of a mundane location into
something pretty ridiculous (the full map of either of those places makes it
pretty clear they were, uh, different). Something like a Don Corneo's mansion
quest that just unravels and unravels.

Raccoon City in RE2, Love Key + The Collector in Hollow Knight, something
becoming a Dwemer ruin in Skyrim.

Something like Ed Harris _The Abyss_ where, to go further, you can't ever
return, you go so deep.

a Prison break? break into a prison to let someone out, maybe someone you don't
like (JJ S3 acquitting the bad-guy style?)

Eternal Darkness Roberto Bianchi tower of flesh

A court with inscrutable rules ("seelie" vs "unseelie" court)

Smullyan puzzles
</pre>

Breaking it down!

> "Delaware". Or Attack The Block-style "unlikely places" for an adventure.

"Delaware" comes from [this Wayne's World skit][12], and [_Attack the
Block_][15] was a cute movie where the alien invasion had to be defended by kids
from communities who normally don't star in these kinds of adventures (starring
young John Boyega!). I was thinking of similar settings that would be atypical
places for a "worldly stakes" adventure.

> Half-Life 2 world of a post quick + decisive invasion. District 9-style
> apartheid, but the prawns are in charge.

Half-Life games were amazing at worldbuilding by dropping you right in the
action and never really containing exposition; thought it might be cool to drop
PC's somewhere where the world is ordered very radically.

> The dream of a child God. Gotta wake the Wind Fish.

Okay, I'm really bitter, because this was the front runner for a while, but then
_Link's Awakening_ got re-released, putting it in many people's minds, so it
would have been mad derivative.

The main inspiration wasn't even _Link's Awakening_, but the _Twilight Zone_
episode [It's A Good Life][1], which was re-made for the movie and parodied in
[a _Simpsons_ Treehouse of Horror episode][2].

So yes, a child God who has little impulse control and too much power would
allow some funny dungeon mechanics and "reality unravel," which comes up later.

> Dungeon in High Fantasy, jump to the far future (subway, guns and shit)

I'd already set up the group preparing for High Fantasy, so I would have loved
to have a reversal where a room is tiled, with "a small, thin glass rectangle in
the center" (a cell phone). Somehow, like Homer [at the end of the 3D Simpsons
episode][13] or [Schala at the end of Chrono Cross][14], they're somewhere
completely incongruous. A boss battle vs. a SWAT team or helicopters might have
been interesting, especially seeing the players RP such a radical change.

> Reality unravel (Celeste Chapter 9, FFVIII time-compressed world)

I love the aesthetic + worldbuilding around racing for the finish as reality
itself is unraveling. _Celeste_ Chapter 9 has some great glitching after
collecting the heart, with flotsam and jetsam floating around space.

> Minish cap: shrink into a tiny house dungeon.

This was a finalist, right after the Wind Fish. I never played _The Minish Cap_
but was thinking of having a dungeon-within-a-dungeon, where a subset of PCs
have to shrink to enter a cube (with a dungeon within it), and the remaining PCs
carry the cube around in a macro-dungeon. So like: tiny party flips switches
inside the cube to turn it blue, macro party sets it in a blue colored slot in
the macro world, etc.  Rotations on the cube, flooding it, etc. while the macro
have to put it in places, escort it, etc.

Black Mesa is a hell of a great setting, but I laughed when I learned how the
facility is "laid out" based on the game structure:

Similarly, Aperture Science is‚Ä¶ impractically built.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/black_mesa_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

One of my favorite tropes is "obscenely elaborate underground hidden thing under
a normal structure," like _Martyrs_, _The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_, _Us_, or
even _The Goonies,_ which is mad overrated. The idea would be to have a silly
beginning adventure (like "extract secret from a cocktail party of socialites")
that has a little hidden passage but it turns out to be a giant fucking dungeon.

> Raccoon City in RE2, Love Key + The Collector in Hollow Knight, something
> becoming a Dwemer ruin in Skyrim.

This one kind of builds on the last, but Raccoon City and it's, uh, _elaborate_
shit around the Police Department (statue puzzles? gemstones in key places? a
sewer path to Umbrella labs?!) is fantastic adventure fodder.

Dwemer ruins in _Skyrim_ were always interesting: cities of fallen dwarves with
extremely advanced machinery.

I have no idea why I put _The Collector_ from HK in here; I hate that guy. Maybe
his laugh?

I like dungeons with a "point of no return." Like, you need to proceed, but
you're never coming back to the world as you know it. This ties into the
reality-unravel themes above.

> a Prison break? break into a prison to let someone out, maybe someone you
> don't like (JJ S3 acquitting the bad-guy style?)

_StarCraft 2_ had a great Prison Break adventure. Prisons are great for this
kind of thing: highly chaotic, heavily guarded, some stealth and some muscle. I
especially liked the idea of blackmail or a specific circumstance meaning the
PC's had to break someone _they hate_ out of prison because they needed them for
something.

> Eternal Darkness Roberto Bianchi tower of flesh

_Eternal Darkness_ was a fantastic fucking game and I'm mad so few people played
it. Short version: a multi-generational story of humans facing off against
colossal beings, Lovecraftian horrors.

One of the adventures (the least fun one, actually, since he was slow and had no
health) had you piloting a Venetian architect named [Roberto Bianchi][3], who
was held captive and tasked with building a ["pillar of flesh."][4]

idk, seemed cool to have some kind of horrifying construction that the PCs would
have to infiltrate and/or sabotage. Alternatively, something like the _Battle of
Endor_ where you break into an in-construction weapon.

> A court with inscrutable rules ("seelie" vs "unseelie" court)

This one made it in, kinda. There's something funny about the ceremony and
rules-ness of court and trials, while also acknowledging how arbitrary it is.
I never read or saw _Alice in Wonderland_ but I understand Alice being tried by
a set of rules she doesn't understand is fun and disorienting.

I wanted our PCs to have to navigate and/or solve some kind of trial process for
a society that does things strangely. This example mentions
faeries, but one can imagine hobgoblins or illithids (well, unlikely to get a
fair trial from illithids, but the point stands lol).

> Smullyan puzzles

Also made it in. Riddles are great, but there's something _especially_
maddening, playful, and delightful from Raymond Smullyan's logic puzzles. When I
publish the adventure, you'll get a taste of a few. I read [_To Mock A
Mockingbird_][5] last year, figured it had a spot.
