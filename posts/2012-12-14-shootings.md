<em><small>Note: I originally wrote this on December 14, the day of the Newtown
shootings, but didn't publish it because I needed some time to cool off, and let
this sit. Here it is, unedited, in all its rage-ey glory, actually published

Today, in light of the news, I've been feeling [pretty much this][13].
Seriously, fuck _everything._

<!-- more -->

But part of what made the whole thing so maddening was the same stupid-shit
things people were saying in response to suggestions of gun control in
light of this, one of [so many][12] mass shootings we get here.

Here are some pretty basic concepts people need to get into their skulls about
gun control and these shootings. First, stop saying the following:

<h3 id="its-not-about-guns-its-about-people">"It's not about guns, it's about people."</h3>

Oh shut the fuck up already. Nobody promoting a discussion on gun control reform
is absolving "people," whatever that means. We _know_ evil, violent, and
unstable people exist in the world (they always have, and they exist even in
places without so many mass shootings!).  _Everybody_ I've spoken who supports
more restrictive gun control would be _thrilled_ if we had a more robust,
available system for people with violent tendencies, and is more than ready to
have that discussion too.

Nobody at any point suggested otherwise, to use this and related phrases at this
point is just a way to deflect a conversation you don't want or are afraid of
having.

To quote [someone else:][1]

> "Guns don't kill people - people do. By the same token, planes don't kill people
> - people flying them into buildings do. And yet, I recall that we immediately
> and decisively worked to keep deranged people from gaining possession of planes
> when a handful of those people used them as tools of mass murder; indeed, we
> made it much more difficult for the overwhelming majority of peaceful,
> law-abiding citizens to board a plane."

Also:

<h3 id="dont-politicize-a-tragedy">"Don't politicize a tragedy."</h3>

Again, spare me. By silencing a challenge to the status quo, you are
politicizing it. Don't tell me when a military-grade assault rifle used to gun
down 20 kindergardeners, that the "assault rifle" part is off-limits.

<img src="/img/2012/12/assault-rifle.png" alt="yeah, this is reasonable" />

<h3 id="the-solution-is-more-gunsthe-victims-could-have-protected-themselves-with-guns">"The solution is more guns/the victims could have protected themselves with guns."</h3>

Jesus, NO. In [61 mass killings, none of them were stopped by civilians with guns.][2]
Do you _really_ suggest students at Virginia Tech (and by extension, every
school in the country) should _always_ bring a gun to every class they attend
for the very remote chance someone will barge in and fire? That Gabby Giffords
(and by extension, all elected officials or people who attend their events)
should keep their hands at her holster at _every_ appearance, and always be
vigilant? Kindergardeners? Kindergarden teachers?

Even _if_ everyone carried concealed weapons _and_ we were all properly trained
_and_ the resulting accidents from having everyone carrying so many guns so much
of the time was magically miniscule ([there were 23,237 accidental firearm
injuries in 2000][3], imagine if every student, teacher and moviegoer had guns
instead of the few that currently do), _the shooters still have the advantage
because they know the attack is coming._ They can put on flak armor, they can
wear masks.

For fuck's sake.

Again, **nobody is denying that mental state is a factor, nobody is saying a
discussion on gun control should exclude or ignore more comprehensive mental
health programs.**

Now that that's been mentioned, let's look at some facts:

* [Where there are more guns, there tends to be more homicide][6]. Correlation,
  not causation, but noteworthy.
* [Places with stricter gun laws tend to have fewer gun deaths][7]. Correlation,
  not causation, but noteworthy.
* [Of the 20 most violent mass shootings of the last 50 years, 11 happened in the USA][8].
  Finland takes 2nd place, with 2.

And because we're not the only country in the world, let's see how others do it:

* [German police fired 85 bullets total in 2011][9]. That's all of Germany's
  police, for the entire country, for an entire year. Meanwhile, the article
  reports that we fired 84 at a murder suspect in Harlem, and about 90 at a
  fleeing unarmed guy in LA.
* In Japan, [to own any firearm (including air rifles)][10], you have to take a
  day-long class, pass a written test, pass a shooting range class, get a mental
  test, a drug test, and a background check. In 2008, when the US had around
  12,000 firearm-related homicides, Japan had 11 (from the article).
* Australia's right-wing prime minister [passed exhaustive gun control][15] for
  semiautomatic and automatic rifles, and shotguns. Firearm homicide went down
  60%, firearm suicide down by 65%.

Again, none of these facts can demonstrate a causal link or prove anything, and
as mentioned previously, there's a _lot_ more to this problem then guns (and
these examples, too -- e.g., Japan has fewer people than we do. Not 1000x fewer,
but fewer). That said, not everyone has these problems at the scale we do (I was pointed
to [this article of a mass stabbing in China][14] by someone to show other
countries have violent people too. As stated previously, that's not the issue, and
never argued against. Nobody died in that attack, guns exacerbate/amplify the
lethality the violent people can inflict).

At the very least, USA: quit acting like even asking the question of whether or
not guns have anything to do with this is some kind of irrational,
freedom-hating response.

I'll end with a bit of an anecdote that came to mind after this tweet, with a
similar message to [this Onion article][4]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The hard truth is that children need to
die, and must die, for your right to bear arms. Just pray they are someone
else's children.</p>&mdash; Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) <a

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Personally I'd rather give up the right to
bear arms. But it's never going to happen.</p>&mdash; Jeff Atwood

Recall the Twilight Zone story [Button, Button][5]. Summarized: a couple is
given a box with a button in it from a stranger. If they press the button, they
will be given $200,000, no questions asked, though someone they've never met
will die. After days of excruciating debate, they press the button. A man shows
up, gives them $200,000, and takes back the box. On the way out he says "time to
give this to the next person... don't worry, it's someone you've never met."

Gabby Giffords isn't an abstraction, a symbol. She's a person, with a family,
who loved and cherished her in their lives. The victims in Colorado weren't
abstractions; they were people out to see a movie, like you probably did
sometime this year. The 20 kindergardeners shot today weren't abstractions.

When you consider the question of whether or not it should be legal to own 10
assault rifles without ever getting background check or psychologically
evaluated, I suggest you really ask yourself how you'd feel about such a right
if it was *your* child, brother, sister, or parent who got shot by some deranged
person when they were going about their lives. Because for 27 families
today, that's what happened.

(An [interactive map][11] on mass shootings in America.)

To go back full circle:

* You'd have to be deluded (at best, more likely stupid and/or ignorant) to get
  offended at the notion that discussion of gun control reform _may_ be in the
  best interest of the citizenry.
* Let's also fucking get some decent mental (hell, **general**) health resources
  in this country.

And oh yeah, fuck everything.
