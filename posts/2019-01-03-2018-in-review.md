    og_description: Greatest hits of 2018, looking forward into 2019.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Let's start with these two.</p>
</div>

Another one in the books. I'm happy to report that I'm ending 2018 feeling like
it was a good year for me. For the planet? For the country? Oh heavens no,
everything is (often literally) on fire. The things we know are terrifying,
and there are tons of horrors we haven't found out yet (did you know [we lost
most of our insects in the last few years?][1]). My generation (and the next,
most likely) will spend our entire lives undoing the damage.

It's not productive to focus on things I can't or haven't invested in changing.
Looking at myself, I'm satisfied with 2018.  Going into it, my theme was
"marathon, not sprint." For most of my life my focus was surviving
moment-to-moment, not choosing to live proactively. It was about minimizing
pain, not maximizing joy. I never built anything to last because I barely wanted
to participate in the present, why would I meaningfully invest in a future?

I'm not out of the woods on these. But with the help of therapy, supportive
networks, the passage of time, a bit of work, and a whole lot of luck, I feel
that I'm trending upwards.

Let's get this recap going 🍾 There's going to be a narcissistic number of
photos of me; don't wanna post photos of other people on Public Internet
without their blessing so these are what you get.

### A year at Lyft 📱🚙

</div>

Most of my "Year in Review" posts start with whatever it looked liked professionally.
In my 5 years in NYC, I've [changed gigs a lot!][31] In early-startup land, team
cohesion matters tremendously, and conditions are volatile. I don't regret any
of my job changes.

I started and am closing this year at Lyft. The NYC office had ~8-10 engineers
when I joined, and now we're bursting at the seams with several dozen (and [a
lot more to come][2]). I've interviewed on the order of 50-60 candidates in two
cities, worked on the most successful monolith → microservices breakdown
initiative I've witnessed ([and I've seen a few][3]), launched a few new features
and services, and am happy to work with one of the most affirming and healthy
teams I've ever been a part of.

I don't know what 2019 will bring. I don't have any intentions of leaving, and
for all my skepticism about VC-backed tech companies and my guillotine
rhetoric, Lyft is probably the employer I've been happiest with in my 10 year
career. I don't feel like they get everything right, but they have a _much_
higher hit rate than I suspected they would coming in.

But: Life is tumultuous! Here's to more 🙂

### Body changes

[Initially wrote about it here][4]. I'm still counting calories (a little less
carefully during the holidays) and doing a lot of strength training. On the year
anniversary (May-ish) I might put up some really douche-ey before/after photos.
It's been a ride.

### Deconstruct

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I wore my Danny Trejo t-shirt because I feel like I can do anything when I do.</p>
</div>

I wrote about why I think its a great conference [here][5], and [expressed some
gratitude][6]. I'll probably write again after my talk [goes up!][7] 😄

### Blogging

Hey! I blogged a lot last year! The motivation was mostly laid out in ["Towards
a More Open Web"][8]: I miss blogs, I miss people blogging. I like most of what I
wrote well-enough, but favorites would be (in chronological order):

* [⛓ＢＬＯＣＫＣＨＡＩＮ⛓][17], wherein I yell at the cloud about a solution
  looking for a problem.

*  [Services, monoliths, and modularity][18] is probably the most-read thing
   I've written on tech; sneaks in some cultural commentary; ending could
   use some tightening.

* [Pablo seeking a date in 2016][19]. Get some non-tech in there. I like the profile
  I built. Got someone to hit a table laughing last week with the line "Java in
  the streets, Erlang in the sheets."

* [What developers mean when they say "Legacy Code."][22] I don't trust us when
  we express distaste for code.

* A two-parter on "we have too many meetings" ([1][20], [2][21]).

* Language ramblings on [Python][23] and [JavaScript][24]

* Reactions to [GitHub's acquisition by Microsoft][25], [Tumblr banning porn][26],
  and my choice to [deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts][27].

To take an old Twitter convention:

👏 PLEASE 👏 WRITE 👏 COMMENTS 👏 ON 👏 THIS 👏 SITE 👏 AND 👏 NOT 👏 SITES
👏 LIKE 👏 FACEBOOK 👏 OR 👏 LINKEDIN 👏 

When the comment sections get hoppin', that's when I'll know I Made It as a
blogger lol.

### Software

</div>

I wrote [a static site generator][9] that produces [this website][10], my first
real project in OCaml. I tried to write a [CommonMark][11] compiler in OCaml but
gave up.

After perusing OCaml's web application offerings, I decided to learn [Elixir][12]
and play with [Phoenix][13] instead. I made and deployed [a stateless, silly
app,][14] built the bones of a much more meaningful one, before shelving it to
build The Next Big Pablo Project, which I'm aiming for general,
embarassingly-early release in February or March.

### Trips

I went to [Burning Man for the second time.][15]

I went to Guatemala for the first time in 5 years and climbed the Acatenango
volcano.

Recently went snowboarding for the first time in 15 years. I ate food
branded by everyone's tío, Danny Trejo.

### Relationships

I tried to be more socially active this year. While previous years were just
barren desert, last year was a desert with some cactuses, and maybe a bird here
and there. I'll try to up this in 2019.

Karen and I have another year under our belt, and we've now lived together for
over a year.

Sapo [had a medical emergency][16]. He had another in November that I didn't blog
about. He's very challenging but I love him very much.

## 2019 Goals

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2019/1/bed_dogs.jpg" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2019/1/bed_dogs_THUMB.jpg" alt="More gratuitous dog photos. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">These guys.</p>
</div>

The main thing — keep the momentum from 2018 going. Keep marathoning, less
sprinting. Mainly:

* Continue therapy and wellness

* Keep building the software I'm working on

* Keep up on efforts to change my body

But, if I'm able to squeeze in a few more, I'm looking at:

* Training Sapo and Rocco to be better dogs. They are… not easy to live with,
  and harder to travel with.

* Make music. I have BA in Music but for many reasons don't really consider
  myself a musician, and have minimal ability to make music. This might look
  like buying a keyboard and piano lessons, or playing with digital sound, like
  transcribing [this process][28] into [Sonic Pi][29].

* Get more familiar with Machine Learning. I have a list of resources, I just
  have to put in the time. A sample project might be to train a model to produce
  a podcaster's voice, make a DeepFake of myself, or extend [ScrabbleCheat][30]
  to do something other than "play the highest move you can find."
