    og_description: I ran a one-shot adventure for friends, read about it and/or adapt it.

<small>ðŸŽµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWurqD68u70">Flashlight</a>, by Parliament.</em> ðŸŽµ</small>

Here's an adapted version of the document I wrote for the D&D one-shot I ran
last weekend. Here's [some rejected ideas for this adventure][2], here's [a set
of cities I wrote for it][3], and [here's all my tabletop stuff, generally.][4]

Onward!

## Mom's Spaghetti (Lose Yourself)

_a one-shot D&D 5E adventure, originally designed for 6th-level heroes._

### Plot Synopsis

Passing through a town brings the attention of our party to a ritual by a
local religion: trial in _The Ulaikeria_. Someone goes in, and they came out.
Go in. Come out. Always. Until one didn't. The religious order in question needs
the party to find that last person, as they can't: once you've come out of the
_Ulaikeria_, you can never re-enter.

Our heroes learn that the person who comes out _is only sometimes, truly, the
person who came in._ Created thousands of years ago for a long-forgotten reason,
this _Mirror Temple_ summons a reflection for every PC and pits them against it.
The PCs are handed character sheets for the mirrors, and must play both
characters trying to escape back to the real world. But only one of them is
allowed to.

A bit of Madeline/Badeline from _Celeste_, a bit of Jordan Peele's _Us_, a bit
of _Saw_, plus a bit of Raiden from MGS2 (I never played it, but apparently it
was a switcheroo, where everyone was excited to be Solid Snake but played 80% of
the game as some guy named Raiden?) the adventure encourages the PCs to confront
the vulnerabilities and insecurities of their characters, play someone who's
entire existence is to challenge their primary PC, and risks that the player has
to make a radical playstyle adjustment for the rest of the campaign.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small"><em>Celeste</em> as a core inspiration shouldn't surprise you at this point ðŸ˜›</p>
</div>

### "Shape"

The adventure was intended to be played in two 2-3 hour sessions (Saturday at,
say, 4:00, ends at 10:00 or 11:00 with a break in between). The breakdown of the
adventure was meant look like this, with hurrying or delay as necessary:

- 0:00-0:10 Intro, getting into popcorn, initial shopping, Q&A. "Chapter 0"
  where PCs re-establish themselves.
- 0:10-1:00 "In-town" adventure, introduce the Gorroliths.
- 1:00-1:30 Enter the temple, reveal the mirrors, explain new mechanics.
- 1:45-? Mirror Temple Part 1, break.

The second set of the session picks up where we left off, nonstop puzzlin' +
brawlin' + RPing until we wrap it up with 1 character of each PC leaves (it
might not be the same one!).

### Cast

_The Ulaikeria_: This cast member is technically a place, but functions a bit
like an NPC. _The Ulaikeria_ is a device akin to showing an iPhone with Siri to
someone medieval: unfathomable in its power or mechanisms, and while it may fool
some into thinking there's sentience there, it's purely mechanical. "An apple
peeler for souls." As focused as GLaDOS is to science and data collection, _the
Ulaikeria_ is to purifying the souls who enter it, and returning the better one.

_Shatsnay_: A candidate Gorrolith who entered _the Ulaikeria_ months ago, she's
the only one who didn't emerge.

_Gorroliths_: Mustard-robed wearing religious order. While folks know them in
Landra, they don't have a memetic structure of growth (like Catholics and the
"make babies" imperative), so their numbers don't increase with population
growth. It means everyone knows something about them or someone who claims to be
one, but people don't often know many.

_Merovech_: Halfling barkeep + owner of _The Chill Basilisk._ Hamster-sized
mutton chops, missing for a few days.

_Vix_: Tabaxi, leader of the Gorroliths in Landra, and guardian of the
Ulaikeria, she presents the PCs the, ahem, opportunity to join the Gorroliths
and figuring out what happened to Shatsnay, and felt like Merovech would be able
to help, but heâ€¦ didn't make it through the Ulaikeria entirely as himself.

Note that one outcome of leaving the _Ulaikeria_ is an inability to communicate
its process too precisely. Like, literally, yellow-robes are known to
feel like something is blocking their throat when they try to talk about it, and
having to assure the person they're speaking to "I literally can't tell you."

### Setting

The "world" is one of the 6 cities if _Eidamesh_, which I [wrote about
previously.][3] I had the players roll a d6 and the mode of the rolls determined
which city we start in. When I ran it for friends, we were in Landra, the
bard sanctuary.

The city itself only really matters for the first section of the adventure: we
do some light city roaming, maybe some stealing or haggling, before we get put
up against the Order. Throw in a few McGuffins (reference a Roc that's
terrorizing the town, or a Lich in a basement, orâ€¦) to hint at what the meaty
adventure is. The cities themselves have variations around:

- What starting equipment they can buy, and what it would cost.
- The kind of fetch quest/rabbit hunt they go after.
- Which NPCs are a part of the above.

After that, they're dropped into the temple.

### Prep

You'll need to create character sheets for "mirrors" for each member of the
party. You'll probably also want to have some backstory in place to get them
together in the starting tavern in the first place, if they haven't been
traveling together.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/flesh_golem.jpg" alt="A Flesh Golem. I didn't pilot it very well." style="margin: 15px auto; max-height: 500px;" />
</div>

### Runbook

Each section and/or room will have a blockquote of sample dialogue to narrate to
the players, like this

> You enter a room that's circular, with 40ft radius, and inexplicably tall
> ceilings, chandeliers hanging at different heights.

**[Bracket bold sections are anecdotes about how it went down when I ran it.]**

**Ojo ðŸ‘€** are for extraneous notes.

#### 0:00-0:10 Scene at _The Chill Basilisk_

The folks end up in a tavern. Ask what one of them ordered to drink. Then let
them know that is **not** what they're drinking; they ordered it, but the
fresh-faced kid at the bar (light peach fuzz, no older than 20) was annoyed
while telling them that they ran out, that the bar owner, Merovech, has skipped
work for the third day and they're running out of supplies.

> Merovech (a halfling with hamster-sized mutton chops) walks in, beelining to a
> door at the back of the bar, but his eyes seemâ€¦ lost? Like he's in a daze. Kid
> at the bar greets him but is ignored. Merovech walks through the back door,
> closes it behind him. A minute later opens the door and says to the kid "Heyâ€¦
> I'm gonnaâ€¦ need you back here for a minute." Then he looks at the PCs, the
> only patrons in this mostly-empty bar, and says "also, I'm not here if anyone
> asks."

Let the players react, then give them a Perception check DC 14. Success means
they hear something like a vault door opening.

> Suddenly, three humanoids in mustard-colored robes enter: a tabaxi, a
> halfling, and human, asking if they've seen a halfling with mutton chops walk
> in here. Let the PCs decide whether to assist them or not.

Whatever the outcome (the PCs might try to enter the back room, they might ask
questions of the new-and-untrusted yellow-robes), it ends with Merovech emerging
from the back having unleased [two Flesh Golems][5], attacking the yellow-robes
and the party. Combat ensues.

If the PC's dilly-dally, you can roll Perception and hear a scream come out the
back. If you want, PCs can roll Perception for free in the battle and see the
face of the young barkeep who served them in the Flesh Golem.

**ðŸ‘€ Ojo: Why this battle, like this?** This was designed as a one-shot, and
combat in D&D is both some people's favorite part of the game, while also
unquestionably the most time-consuming and hardest to run logistically,
especially since I was doing this for 5 6th-level characters. I didn't know how
long we were truly going to last (there was always the risk that our friends
would get bored of D&D after so much of it a few hours in) so I wanted to make
sure we got at least 1 good combat encounter before getting into the meat.

#### Extra: The Trial

**[I didn't run this section in my play-through; I didn't initially know how
long our combat round would last (surprise, longer than I thought), and it
would've felt really forced to do this section anyway, based on how the PCs
handled the last section. I include it here for posterity and/or if you'd like
to run this over multiple sessions.]**

**ðŸ‘€ Ojo: Why this section?** Giving the players a choice over which city be
have our adventure in, I started with the idea "what could be a Landra-specific
fun thing to do?" and thought an unorthodox court of justice would be a way to
go.

---

It starts with manufacturing some conflict with the yellow-robed Gorroliths (one
of them died in the crossfire, they "have claim" to Merovech who died, they want
his body and the PCs don't want to give him). You don't need a particularly
strong claim, if there's an obvious dispute with the PCs you can use a crowd
gathering around the commotion.

> Much like a Kindergardener hearing someone swearing and going
> "ahhhHHHHHHHHHH!!!!" you hear a few chants around you: "trial. trial. trial.
> trial! trial! trial! Trial! Trial! TRIAL! TRIAL!"
>
> A crew assembles around you. The starter of the chant pulls a few other
> chanters and bystanders to their side. One pulls out a dunce cap and places it
> on a body. "It's the judge!" The Gorroliths get pushed into a group, someone
> slaps a barrister wig on them. "It's the Plaintiffs!" A few run after and put
> a wig on a PC "It's the defendents!"
>
> TRIAL! TRIAL! TRIAL!

The crime is manslaughter or unleashing magical entity and property damage _for
non-artistic means_.

Each "round" involves the party picking 3 representatives to make arguments.
They can use either Persuasion, Intimidate, Deception, or History. Their
opponents will make counterarguments using the same skills. _Both sides pick
their three independent of the other._ Then the "round" happens, with all three
happening in sequence against each other. Each side rolls, and depending on how
they interact, one or more side may get a "shift".

<pre style="font-size: 14px; background-color: #e8e8e8;">
   Yours | Theirs ->
|------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
|            |  Persuasion  |  Intimidate | Deception | History |

I = Independent test. You can both get a shift or neither get a shift. DC 16.
V = Versus test. Winner gets a shift.
- = Definitive victory. Auto shift, no roll.
x = Definitive loss. Opposing party gets shift.
</pre>

First to 10 shifts wins.

This is absolutely stolen from conflict in _Mouse Guard._

**WIN:** The players are owed by the Gorroliths. Gorroliths gift them a magical
item from their vault, which contains some selection of them.

**LOSE:** They owe a Debt to the Gorroliths. Gorroliths take them on Shatsnay
and Cordonoy test.

Either way takes them to the Ulaikeria ðŸ˜Ž

#### Win Magic Vault

Players can pick 3 items.

- Ring of Free Action (no paralysis, restrained, difficult terrain not a
  problem).
- Ring of Animal Influence
- Ring of Water Walking
- Dust of Disappearance (4 uses)
- Headband of Intellect

#### Shatsnay

If owed a debt, the Gorroliths tell them of Shatsnay, a very promising pupil who
was to enter their order. The Ulaikeria has a simple rule that's never been
broken: 1 enters, 1 returns. Every time. Exceptâ€¦ Shatsnay.

Shatsnay never emerged. In the 300 year history of the Gorroliths, this has
never happened. Go to the Ulaikeria and determine what happened.

If a PC asks "but can't you go?", explain that once you enter the _Ulaikeria_,
you can't return.

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">A bit of Bizzarro Superman here, too.</p>
</div>

#### 1:00-1:15 Enter _The Ulaikeria_

> The entrance is a circular dais, on its own platform in the middle of the
> room. As each party member steps on the dais, they start to vanish, and as
> they do, the remaining party members feels their memories also erasing.
> Paintings of them are morphing, songs of them now contain another name. Only
> when they step back on the dais and start vanishing themselves do their
> memories flood back, a demonstration of the power contained.
>
> One by one you reappear, and find yourselves into a well, if confusingly-lit
> room of limestone walls and a sharply sloped ceiling, like being in a giant
> Toblerone bar. Bisecting the room is a large mirror reflecting you.
>
> Except, it isn't. Your reflection isn't moving. It's staring at its feet, or
> more appropriately, at a platform in front of the mirror, with imprints of
> feet, waiting for someone to stand on it.

As each of the PCs stands on the platform, DM role-plays the initial
conversation, which is a confrontation. The role-playing obviously must happen
one-at-a-time, but in-game this is happening for every player at the moment they
stand on the platform and face their reflection, so if they approach it
one-at-a-time, that's how it happens in-game. If they all step in at once,
they're all having their conversations simultaneously. The DM provides the first
segment of dialogue for the mirrors. See the appendix at the bottom for some
sample. After you deliver them:

> The mirror cracks, splits, then finally shatters. Behind it is a pane of clear
> glass. Your reflection is staring back behind you, looking as alarmed as you
> are. It just met you for the first time, too. An ominous voice rings in your
> ears, in your native tongue:
>
> "Welcome to the Ulaikeria, a sifting bowl of souls. Competition breeds
> winners. You and your reflection are certain you are the real one. But that
> can't be true. Both of you entered, one will leave. You'd best ensure it is
> you."

Reveal the tokens of the mirrors, place them on the map. Hand out the character
sheets to your players.

> For the remainder of the adventure, you'll be playing as two characters, one in
> each party: the one that you came in as, and their opposite. One of
> you will leave. You are, to the best of your ability, to play them both with the
> intention of winning out. Take 5-10 minutes familiarizing yourself with the
> second sheet, and we'll work out dynamics of the second party together. Then
> we have a temple to escape. For both parties, a door slides open on the south
> side of the room, revealing the path forward.

### Ulaikeria

Running _Ulaikeria_: Each party goes through each room seperately. Sometimes
the rooms are identical, and each can provide different tactics; other times,
they're of the same _kind_ (like a riddle).

Then, you as a DM decide which you feel like went "faster" in game time. The
overarching narrative is that they're racing to the exit. That determines who
enters the final room first.

**[When running this with friends, we found the mirror party would have a slight
advantage if they went second, since they'd be "warmed up" after the first
party. I recommend you run it as Core/Mirror, then the next room as Mirror/Core,
and so on.]**

#### Animal menagerie

> You enter a room filled â€” utterly _filled_ â€” with hundreds of small creatures.
> Chipmunks, foxes, squirrels, rabbits, cats, sparrows, frogs. There's foliage
> and trees to match.
>
> Ulaikeria speaks to you: "acquire the key from they who possess it."

Mechanically, this looks like a game of Battleship. Roll a d100 and another d100
for x/y coordinates of the winning animal. If they can find the animal on that
coordinate (either killing it or picking it up) they will get the key.

The PCs have options here, and each party will probably use different ones:

- Anyone who can speak to animals will have an advantage of splitting the search
  space.

- You can slaughter the creatures, it'll be inside one.

- Inspection of the animals (picking one up) will tell you if it has a key or
  not.

Murderous parties (which, lets face it, is most mirrors of heroes) will probably
unload a lot of ammo and spells to clear out swaths of them.

Speaking to animals will provide at the very least a bisection of the search
space ("that way", which cuts out half the room). Each animal has a
riddle, if it is answered correctly, they split it even further in half.

Here are a few riddles:

> It can pierce the best armor, And make swords crumble with a rub. Yet for all
> its power, It canâ€™t harm a club.

Answer: Rust.

> What is black when you buy it, red when you use it, and white when you throw
> it away?

Answer: Coal.

> What tastes better than it smells?

Answer: A tongue.

> Better old than young; the healthier it is, the smaller it will be.

Answer: A Wound.

> What is not alive but grows, does not breaths but needs air.

Answer: Fire

#### Smullyan

One party:

> You know three men: John, James, and William. John and James always lie,
> William only tells the truth, the three are identical in appearance. You see
> one of them on the street, and you'd like to know if it's John (he owes you
> money). You are allowed to ask him one question of only three words; what do
> you ask?

"Are you James?". John will say yes, because he lies, but James and William will
say no.

Second party:

> I offer you one of three prizes: A (the best prize), B (the middling prize),
> or C (the bad prize). The rules are such: if you make a true statement, I will
> give you either Prize A or Prize B. If you make a false statement, I will give
> you Prize C.
>
> It's easy to see how you could get Prize A or Prize B: say something like "two
> plus two is four." But suppose you had your heart set on Prize A: how can you
> assure that you'll get it?

"You will not give me Prize B." If you give me Prize C, then you gave it to me
for making a false statement. If you give me B, you give me B for a false
statement. Only A satisfies your constraints.

#### "Make a trade"

> There's nothing in this room but another dais and a door. _Ulaikeria_
> communicates to you: "Make a trade"

Each party chooses one person to swap into the other for the next trials. The
first person to step on the dais is sent to the other party. They're there with
them _without the door opening_ for a few minutes of RP. After some interaction,
the door opens.

The way I ran this, timing-wise:

- Core Party picks someone
- Mirror Party picks someone (in both cases, a rogue party member just ran onto
  it without gathering consensus lol).
- Mirror Party receives the Core Party member.
- Core Party receives Mirror Party member.

From the character's perspective, this is meant to happen more-or-less at the
same time.

These characters may attack each other! Our mirror character, for example,
jumped onto the dais because she believed the Core Party was, on the whole,
"better people." (and they were!). But her Core wasn't the one that switched!

You can explore variations of this as a DM: I didn't enforce that the core and
the mirror had to be the "same." It meant that each room was missing one of the
players from the action (and had nothing to do), but the other party had that
player piloting both core and mirror in the same room, which led to some
interesting interactions.

I also thought of doing this again further down the adventure. We were hitting
our limits (time, energy) so we cut out a few things but if you have a few more
"trials" it's something to consider.

#### "Survive"

<div class="caption-img-block-2" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/umber_hulk_THUMB.jpg" alt="An umber hulk" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
<img src="/img/2019/11/bulette_THUMB.png" alt="A bullette." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

Both parties straight-up fight some monsters. These are what I picked for my
6th-level parties:

##### Fight 1 (Mirror or Core)

[**Bulette**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bulette) ("Land Shark"):

- AC 17, 94 HP, 40ft speed.
- Bite: +7 to hit, 4d12 + 4 damage
- Leap: If jumping greater than 15ft and land on a space with characters. DC 16
Dex or Strength save for half and no prone. If fail, prone. 3d6 + 4 bludgeon +
3d6 + slashing.

[**Umber Hulk**](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=umber-hulk) ("big ole' bug-eyed thing, like a giant beetle"):

- AC 18, 93 HP, 30ft speed
- Multiattack: 2 claw attacks, 1 mandible attack
- Claw: +8 to hit, 1d8 + 5
- Mandible: +8 to hit, 2d8 + 5

##### Fight 2 (other one)

We didn't actually run this fight for time/energy constraints, last one took a
lot out of us lol. But the plan was to have the mirrors fight a
[**Gorgon**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gorgon) and a [**Giant
Crocodile**](https://dnd5e.info/appendices/appendix-mm-a-miscellaneous-creatures/crocodile-giant/).

**ðŸ‘€ Ojo, why again?** Again, D&D loves to put people in combat. Also, while we
skipped it for the mirrors in my game, it's another way to familiarize your
players with the truly different experience of playing the mirror.

#### "What's the password"

> The characters enter a somewhat expansive room with a door on the other edge.
> There are wall hangings and juts to climb, vines along the walls, and a
> "canopy" layer of platforms hanging off the wall. There's a
> [Hadozee](https://faerunian.fandom.com/wiki/Hadozee) (ape person) in a chair
> in the middle of the room. They wake, look around, looking confused.
> _Ulaikeria_ speaks to your mind: "Exit through them."

The inspiration of this room was the image of a group of PC's torturing a
helpless sentient creature; tying them to a chair, that king of thing. After the
small creatures room before, some party (either the PCs or their mirrors) would
look at violent, forceful, coercive means to get what they think this creature
is holding back from them, and others will collaborate.

The wall hangings and canopy layer give the Hadozee a place to escape to if
needed, since it's likely that someone will try to hurt or kill it.

DM-ing this scene, I'd suggest playing by ear. This is really the PC's vs.
themselves and/or the mirror they traded for, more than them vs. the Ape.

**[When we played it, one player's mirror straight-up attacked the Hadozee. They
rolled well enough to cut an arm off and break bones in the face. The Hadozee
then hid, and the non-aggressive party members and the ape solved an ad hoc
puzzle together where they learned the Hadozee had to verbally forgive the first
character. That required the character to apologize verbally; the Hadozee then
demanded they drop all their weapons and armor.]**

Other ideas:

- they kill the ape and cast a spell like _animate dead_ or _speak with dead._
- interrogation, like the "tied to a chair" scenario.
- If they dismember the ape, they need to reassemble it a certain way.

I played the Ape as not knowing what they were doing there and/or very confused.

**ðŸ‘€ Ojo** this is a challenging scene to run with both parties and not have it
feel like a distinct advantage for whoever went second. We did this in lieu of
the second combat encounter, but you might want another
cooperative-but-ambiguous test that requires patience, and comfort with
ambiguity.

#### Motorcycle race

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/11/ffvii_motorcycle_THUMB.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy VII art with Cloud on a motorcycle." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">smdh if you weren't super into the Crazy Motorcycle sequence in FFVII, with it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrwQPtxR36M">awesome music</a> as well.</p>
</div>

**[We didn't end up running this room; I was feeling like I needed to wind it
down, and the mechanics I had in place felt, frankly, underbaked. But the
initial premise is cute, I think, and one could imagine mechanics that made this
fun.]**

> The room is cramped, dark, and mildewey. There's a window at the other end
> showing something like a racetrack? It can be observed but not joined.
>
> In the center of the room is an elevated platform with a saddle. Ulaikeria
> speaks to you: "pick your steed, pick your rider. A pair who can stop the
> other horse."

Each party picks a steed and a jockey. The "steed" becomes a horse, then they
gotta race the other party! The idea was to have them get to some
distance in feet (1000?) while the other players watched. The "steed" chosen
could get buffs based on their skills or their rolls, while the "jockey" could
assist their steeds and/or launch missiles or cast spells on the other steed.

The initial formulation was something like:

Each round: 60ft base speed + 1d20 + steed modifier (Animal Handling, Dexterity,
Athletics, + some if they had class abilities (Monk movement speed) + 10 if the
jockey was small (Halfling or Gnome) and the steed at least Medium). Each party
rolls a round like this to get comparable distance from the other.

_Then_ we do attack rolls, where the jockey can cast missiles, spells like
_Grease Floor_, hell, even cantrips like _Thaumaturgy_ to flare up torches for
distractions. Whatever they deemed best; I'd let them get creative. This would
serve as penalty for the other party on the next roll.

You want some rubber-band mechanic to make it so a lead is harder to keep.

I also wasn't sure of what the "prize" should be for winning; one silly option
is to not let the other steed turn back for the next room; or just declaring
that room "won" by the winning party for the score when tallying up the final
room and who gets there first.

#### Final Room (and maybe Shatsnay and Cordonoy)

Shatsnay and Cordonoy were originally Easter eggs hidden in the dungeon, and the
"true ending" of this adventure, a bit like the White Pages in _MYST_ vs. siding
with the Blue Book or Red Book brother. Each room was meant to have a hidden
clue that, in the last room, can reveal the passphrase that will unlock where
they've hidden. Shatsnay, a Dragonborn sorcerer, was dropped into the
_Ulaikeria_ and Cordonoy is what she's named her mirror. I didn't end up
sprinkling the clues there correctly, but it's an option if you adapt this.

Most people and their mirrors would get at each other's throat at some point or
another, but Shatsnay found a hack: a close look at Cordonoy shows scarring
around her head. She's kept alive, but subdued, per a lobotomy.

Shatsnay doesn't want to leave; if the PCs try to take her, it initiates a
battle. At the DMs discretion, you can make this as hectic as possible.

**[I played this very differently in my game. Trying to wind down, I determined
a "winning" party for the rest of the dungeon and gave them a 1-round head start
to the exit. The next round, the second party came in. There was a big open door
on the other side, and had Shatsnay and Cordonoy just seated, relaxing in the
middle. I wanted there to be some conflict around wanting to escape vs. engage
the Dragonborn vs. engage the other party, but in practice, most were just
gunning for the open exit. This was good and tense, but a suggestion from one of
my players seemed a whole lot better: the door only opened if someone was
standing on a switch. Then they'd _have_ to engage, somehow, instead of racing
as wildly as they did.]**

This was a 6th-level adventuring party, so I made Shatsnay a level 9 sorcerer
with some devastating spells, and Cordonoy a melee attacker with the battle
traits of a troll.

If a PC or mirror makes it out the open door, their counterpart begins to
vanish, _Avengers Thanos Snap_ style. They're welcomed back in the Gorrolith's
temple, and are offered tea and a yellow robe.

## Appendix: Lore FAQs

**What the hell happened with Merovech?** Merovech had the secret hobby of
making Flesh Golems, like when you find out that friend from the office is a
secret prepper who's got a bunker with guns, ammo, and rations for years. The
Merovech who enters _The Chillest Basilisk_ is actually Merovech's mirror, who
escaped _The Ulaikeria_ and now the Gorroliths want to follow-up with him, calm
him down after his trauma. He wants none of it, thinks "my time has finally
come," and unleashes the Flesh Golems.

**What's the deal with the Gorroliths?** They're a cult founded around _The
Ulaikeria._ There may be a bit of Stockholm Syndrome involved, but they feel
like they truly _earned_ their place in the world rather than simply inhabiting
it by default, the way most people who are merely _born_ do. And because they
won over another, literally confronting their own opposites, they feel very
strongly that the best version of themselves is walking through the world.

**Where did the Ulaikeria come from?** It's never explained precisely, but it's
an invention by one of the old proto-gods, like someone from the future dropped
an iPhone in the Middle Ages. It might still be monitored, it might have been
forgotten, it definitely had a purpose in its design (like an apple peeler) but
none of that matters, what matters is that it's been found, and the people
who've come through it _really_ think it defines their existence.

## Appendix: Sample mirrors

### Flek mirror

_Flek is a Goblin Barbarian with a [Primal Path that allowed spellcasting.][1]
In-game, this was justified as being the result of an encounter with an artifact
that wiped out his whole tribe._

Initial Dialogue:

> Pathetic! You touched its holy energy and learned the exact wrong lessons.
> Imagine being given an elixir of life and using it to wash your ass: that's
> what you've done! A waste! Not of the lives of those rag-wearing nomads, but
> of a singular power, in _that_ filty vessel.
>
> Your anger controls you. You're carnage on the battlefield.
>
> I have mastered it. I am an artist.

Flek's mirror is a Monk who is fast and disciplined; the most proud and
articulate goblin you've ever seen. He sweeps the leg and looks good doing it.

### Wilrion mirror

_Wilrion is a Paladin with 19 Strength with an evil brother who murdered his
parents, setting Wilrion on a path to vengeance in the name of his family._

Initial Dialogue

> True strength is of the mind. Why lift a heavy boulder when I can get a brute
> like you to do it for me? Mathal was right about you: too rigid, too certain,
> too dumb. He's not even trying that hard to evade you and you still haven't
> caught him. It's obviously not worth catching him, but I will when I get out,
> and I'll be less of burden on the world when I do.

Wilrion's mirror is a Rogue who's very well-stacked to slip in and out of
battles. He's _wily_, murders capriciously, and ruthless.

### Maescia mirror

_Maescia is a Druid who worked for a financial institution in Sestia playing
boths sides of the civil war for profit. She's excellent at corporate espionage
due to her ability to take an animal's form._

Initial Dialogue

> I don't know who should win the conflict, but I do know who should lose. You.
> You're despicable, and don't deserve the the heart that beats to keep you
> alive. Sestians and Glory: they have principles. Values. You only have
> yourself, or worse, your masters. Transform into a hog and stay that way; it's
> a nobler existence.

Maescia's mirror is a necromancer, a wizard who's eventual goal is to use
the magical power from the dead of the conflict to end it. A bit like Ozymandias
in _Watchmen_ dropping the giant squid over Manhattan, who she sides with
personally matters less to her than simply ending the conflict.

Opportunism and deception of all kinds repel her: why _generate_ new resources
when the dead are right there? She never lies, speaks plainly, and always wins.

### Bowie mirror

_Bowie is a Bard, the 7th child in a line of nobles who's known a fair bit of
comfort ("an inveterate partier") while also being a shrewd, talented diplomat
and courtier._

Initial dialogue

> I see you're still trapped. Trapped by the rules: of law, of succession, of
> norms and customs. Your power is limited this way, I've found what you've been
> missing: chaos. Passion. A disregard for the things you hold dear are the key
> to unlocking your true power.

Bowie's mirror is a Barbarian who's self-interested, impulsive, impatient, but
hones these characteristics to get fantastic results quickly. He's burned almost
every bridge he's crossed, both literally and figuratively.

### Elena mirror

_Elena is a Warlock who suffered extreme trauma at the hands of a religious
cult, and got glorious, murderous revenge on all of them. Now she uses her
alliance to the extraplanar entity to mercilessly rip those who'd abuse their
power to shreds. Highly chaotic._

> I pray for your healing, and will be happy to assist you on your journey to
> wholeness. It's okay to feel scared. Your vengeance will be your undoing.
>
> It's an honor to serve Pelor. Through his generosity I've been able to heal
> myself and others. It will never be enough, and I will never be enough. But I
> can keep working at it.

Elena's mirror is a meek, generous, giving, orderly cleric who's response to
trauma is to heal all those around her. She's extremely self-critical, humble,
cold-as-steel and capable cleric with extreme healing potential.

## Grab bag

Here are chamber ideas I didn't flesh out enough to have a concrete idea how to
play, but you can probably adapt to something playable.

#### Pass the baton

Key in the center of the room, surrounded by a pit with spikes, a narrow walkway
to get across. Hand the key to someone who has to dive deep into water, to
hand off to someone else, who has toâ€¦

The idea was a _Ninja Warrior_ course of abilities, seeing how each party would
handle them.

#### A room of light, tactile or sound navigation

Bright light ("White Blindness," a la JosÃ© Saramago) that makes players navigate
"blind."

#### Audio puzzle

These are fun; have clues in the sounds of the room.

#### Lowest Ability Score showdown

Pick an ability score (e.g. Strength), pick the characters from the parties with
the lowest values in that score, have them do a showdown together.

#### Pit puzzle

There's a pit in the room that you can't see the bottom of. Players can descend,
"go fishing," try to illuminate, flyâ€¦ another ability showcase. Maybe put some
traps in there.

## Variations

The first draft of this allowed the possiblity that your mirror wasn't _you_
(name, physique, and race being the same) but some other manifestation of what
you're confronting, so they could be a totally different being, a bit like the
Seekers in Celeste's Mirror Temple, instead of Badeline herself. Or Glenn
before he was Frog.
