    og_description: Karen and I have villagers we hate, large companies are different, I baked some.

Our Animal Crossing island has a north beach, which was hard to see and only
accessible in the second week or so of the game, since you needed a ladder to
climb to it. Karen, in love with secrets and mischief, set a scene there
involving a campfire next to cardboard furniture, as well as a town bulletin
saying "come to Bad Idea Beach with 50 bells for a gud time ‚Äî acab."

Turns out that Bad Idea Beach is on everyone's island, and it's how [Redd][6],
the fake-art peddling shyster, visits your island. [Suz Hinton hates Redd][1] (as
do I), but he apparently has a following. Someone responded to her tweet with
this Tumblr meme, which is super accurate:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/4/bill_wibbly.png" alt="graphic of text saying &quot;animal crossing players are like I HATE Bill Wibbly!, he's a BASTARD and I want him OFF my island, he KILLED my family and BURNED my crops but then I look up Bill Wibbly or whatever and he looks like&quot; with a picture of an adorable animal." style="margin: 15px auto; max-width: 500px" />
</div>

Our "Bill Wibbly" is [Maggie][2]. idk man, she's just boring, schep. She's never
crafting cool things and her house sucks. In a display of Animal Crossing karma,
we got Maggie after Karen mounted a campaign to drive away [Nan][3], who _I_
liked but somehow offended Karen with her unassuming demeanor. "I want birds!"
Karen said, kicked out the sweet lamb, and now we've got a pig who sucks.

(in Karen's defense, we also got [Phoebe][4] later, who fucking rules. [Look at
her house!][5])

Anyway, you should come by. Our native flower is the lily, our "sister" flower
is hyacinths, our fruit is oranges (though we have all the fruit, happy to
share). We also have nearly every hybrid flower (and copies of some of them
you can take). Or invite me over, I'd love to see your house. Switch friend

## Big companies

Patrick McKenzie [has a good, succinct list][20] of why things take longer and
require more resources at big companies:

> Inspired by a thread on HN incredulous about engineering headcount at a large software company:
> 
> The biggest thing people don‚Äôt appreciate about large companies is the basic
> productive unit isn‚Äôt an individual it is an engineering team with about ~8
> members.
> 
> You need a team, and not an individual, because you need to be able to:
> 
> * give vacation
> * rotate a pager
> * mentor junior engineers
> * do professional development
> * interface with other teams
> * maintain existing systems
> * do speculative development
> * pay the ‚Äúorganizational tax‚Äù

someone in a response linked to [this Dan Luu post][21], which is excellent
supplemental reading. The classic (from 2003!) is [Eric Lippert's "How Many
Microsoft Employees does it take to change a lightbulb?"][23].

(Also, when reading Dan Luu posts, I'm super grateful for [Firefox Reader
View][22]).

My eyes roll pretty hard hearing a certain class of complaints startup
kids throw at large employers. I get that they can't help it since they don't
know any better. It's worse because it usually contains a healthy bit of ageism
and/or hustle porn for good measure ("employees at [X] aren't serious about
their work" they say, looking at exactly one employee who goes home at 6:00 to
spend their one and only life treasuring their time with their kids, or
cultivating a different passion).

This isn't to say you can't or shouldn't criticize large orgs! Playing the large
org game well is its own kind of hard, and even accounting for all üëÜ a company 
can still have terrible practices. For my part, I really prefer the increased
ownership and velocity of smaller companies. And if getting rich and/or getting
on _Fast Company_ covers and/or spraying your seed to be felt across the world
is something that matters to you, doing it as an card-carrying employee of a big
company is a long and uncertain path by which to do it. But please understand
that the reason large companies work the way they do isn't because someone as
clever as you hasn't shown up to tell them to do it differently. This shit's
hard.

### Cooking

Made some biscuits which were‚Ä¶ not great. Recipe called for unsalted butter and
let you add salt to the batter "so you have full control," but as a result these
really only tasted like baked flour. Got the layering right though, they did
flake and split the way they should.

As my first foray into biscuits, they were okay. Fine enough jelly-delivery
vehicles. But future biscuits will be buttery, fluffy and enduring. I will soon
be One With the Biscuits.

Also made some banana bread that I was super skeptical about (the muffins from
last time didn't come out fantastic), but this may be the best thing I've ever
baked. Moist, just the right amount of sweetness, it didn't last the weekend.

What's interesting is to compare the batter of this and the "muffins" I made
last week. Mostly the same stuff (and in even roughly the same quantities!) but
the banana bread recipe called for the sugar in the wet ingredients before
mixing with flour, but the muffin recipe put the sugar in with the flour.
The texture difference was _wild_.

So you heard it here: sugar is not to be treated as a dry ingredient.
