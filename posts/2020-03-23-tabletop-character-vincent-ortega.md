    og_description: Description of my Cold City character, Vincent Ortega

Been a while since I posted one of [my tabletop characters][4], so here's one for a
campaign we just finished! This was technically a [_Fate_][1] campaign, but we
only used its mechanics; the setting was pulled from the game [_Cold
City_][2].

_Cold City_ describes itself as:

> A game of hidden agendas, trust and monster hunting.
>
> Berlin, 1950: While the Cold War rages, the secretive agents of the
> multi-national Reserve Police Agency creep through the shadows, hunting down
> the remnants of bizarre technologies and twisted wartime experiments.
>
> But the RPA is driven by paranoia, fear and suspicion. Everyone works to their
> own hidden agendas, the different nationalities look at each other through a
> haze of mistrust. In the darkness, faced by horrors beyond your worst
> nightmares, will your comrades watch your back or treacherously stick a knife
> into it?
>
> The great battles may be over, but the war carries on.

So a bit like being members of the BRPD in _Hellboy_, in the setting of
_The Third Man_, with a lot of Lovecraftian horror.

Meet Vincent Ortega, cast in my head as a young Edward James Olmos!

## Vicente "Vincent" Ortega

Vicente was born in 1916 in Cuba to a wealthy family, his father being a rum
producer for Bacardi. Raised on a palacial estate with multiple stables, he was
the youngest of three, to an older brother Mat√≠as and sister Alma. The family's
fortunes changed dramatically in 1933, after the Seargant's Revolt, where all
their property was confiscated and his father imprisoned. Grabbing whatever they
could hastily, his mother and two siblings fled to Miami.

Going from opulent wealth to existential struggle, his mother and siblings
turned ugly. The crisis led Alma to crime, stealing the family's little cash and
running away with con artists. Their mother became ill and asked Vicente and
Mat√≠as to find food or shelter any way they could.

Coming back from a laboring gig having collected $2, another desperate man
assaulted him, stealing the money and running. He chased the man into an
alley, where the man was expecting him and beat him further, trying to squeeze
anything else he could out of him. At this point, a third man entered the alley
and incapacitated the robber, and gave Vicente back his wages. Vicente went to
the incapacitated man and left one of his dollars, "he seems to need this as much
as I do. Maybe this can save the next person."

Seeing this, the third man introduced hiself as Michael McNally, a reverand of
the Gesu Church. Touched by Vicente's charity, he assisted in arranging housing
for Mat√≠as and their mother. He noted Vicente's potential for a life in the
cloth, and took him under his wing. He also taught him basic self-defense
techniques. He started going by "Vincent."

When the US entered the war in 1941, he'd already been training for a life in
the priesthood, and was employed as a military chaplain in the European theater.
He tended to many wounded soldiers, did some closet baptisms for soldier's
"away babies," administered first aid, and learned a bit about the new
technologies that were in use (Morse code via teletype, how to read radar,
etc.). But one day, a German POW demanded a chaplain, yelling frantically. He
claimed that one of the other POWs was in need‚Ä¶ of an exorcism? He and another
chaplain, Eric Adams, went to see what it was about.

Vincent was confused; he'd obviously never performed an exorcism nor had any
understanding of what to expect. This man obviously needed psychiatric help, not
spiritual? But they humored him. "Part of being a man of the cloth is a bit of
theater, after all," so he and Eric "improv-ed" a ceremony that caught the
attention of the German. It seemed to be going well, but Eric wasn't letting the
scene wind down; as Vincent was ready to end the act, Eric started going in
harder. Vincent got a little worried, saw the German prisoner starting to
convulse, when the electricity went out and the bulbs in the room popped. The
German prisoner lay dead, Vincent was shocked, and Eric looked‚Ä¶ affected. The
initial screaming prisoner looked relieved, Eric and Vincent retired for the
night and tried to continue their duties through the war.

Eric never seemed quite the same after that, and after the war, Eric stayed in
Europe, with Vincent returning to Miami. Only a year later, Vincent got a letter
from Eric asking him to return, since "they were both required to finish what
was started. This is for the good of your church, as well." The next
day, one of his parishioners collapsed during a service, and died with their
face misconfigured in the same position the exorcised POW did. Vincent accepted
the invitation and took a boat out to Europe.

**Personal Goal:** Affirm the goodness of God, especially in light of the
mysteries he encounters and the presence of Evil.

**National Goal:** Increase the RPA's dependence on the USA by finding
opportunities for the USA to provide materials, provisions, and supplies for RPA
use.

## Draw scene

_Cold City_ has a notion of a "draw scene," one which introduces how your
character got into the RPA, ending with a decision and a roll that impacts their
adventures. Vincent's was his reunion with Eric. I wrote a little script for it:

---
"Vincent, my boy! Come here, you heathen!"

Eric embraced Vincent, and for a moment, Vincent forgot that anything was amiss
at all; Eric was, after all, his friend as a military chaplain, and they really
did share a lot of memories helping people.

"Eric‚Ä¶ it's good to see you. You almost make me miss Europe."

They went to a bar to have a few drinks. Vincent gave Eric a carton of American
cigarettes, and they exchanged stories of their last few years. Vincent's time
in Miami has been a relief, but the new paster Rev. McAtee was still finding his
footing. His mother was ill, and still insisting they were going to go back to
Cuba someday.

Eric didn't return to the States; he took his rudimentary German and stayed in
Berlin. His German got pretty good, expresses opinions on a few local churches
("the Reformed are worse than the Anglicans, let me tell ya."). Eventually, he
looks Vincent in the eyes.

"I'm terribly sorry about Alice."

Alice was one of of Vincent's parishioners. She was in her mid-fifties when
she suffered from what looked like a heart attack in the middle of a sermon. In
her last moments of life, she was reaching for Vincent, who was clearing people
to give her space while others were practicing first responder techniques. She
was obviously in pain and struggling for most of it, when her head suddenly
turned, eyes got big, and had a wicked smile on her face. A nervous crowd of the
church was suddenly abjectly terrified.

Vincent: "I've never seen anyone in my church that frightened. And I had cause
to be more frightened than the rest."

He pulls out his postcard from Eric.

"We never did debrief that night appropriately. I'd like to know what you know."

Eric: "It's a big part of why I'm still here. I think about you, and that night,
often, brother. I think we're well-served by switching from glasses to flasks."

The two men walk, affected but not stumbling, out into the streets, with Eric
leading further and further away from the city square. They ocassionally
converse, but the words don't come out as smoothly. A lot more cigarettes get
smoked. Eric offers some jerky, and they chew on it. Dusk falls, and by now
they're surrounded by as much dirt as rubble.

Vincent: "Where are we going?"

Eric: "To see the man we saved that day."

They come upon a graveyard. Eric walks towards a mausoleum, Vincent following.
The air contains a slight chill. Eric tosses Vincent a flashlight, and they make
their way in.

Vincent: "He got buried in a mausoleum?"

Eric: "He sure did"

Vincent: "And it's important we go there‚Ä¶ to see‚Ä¶"

Eric: "Soon, my friend! Soon."

Eric continues, "this city, for the record, has not made it easy to follow-up on
that night. It's half-rubble, everyone's denying their role in government or
functionary roles, and everyone is taking advantage of this situation, including
out-of-towners like us! Crimes happen daily, which would be a major, citywide
scandals back home, but there's so much happening, and so few people to witness
it, a lot slides under the cracks."

He points the flashlight at a name "URLICH PETTUS" -> "He was one of my first
friends in the city. Taught me great slang. I think it was the stress."

He points at another: "ERIC ADAMS" -> "Eric was saved that day."

Eric snatches the flashlight out of Vincent's hands.

"DON'T RUN. WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT."

Vincent: "Eric, please, to remove agency is not a Godly choice. Our choice to
follow God is what gives our faith our power. The same is true in our bond.
Please, give me back the flashlight, I will not leave you."

"Eric": "Vincent... we've been given a gift. You need some help to find it. And
I only have half of mine. I'd like you to join me."

"In what?"

"In a greater power. God is in this world. And he is not alone."

The sound of cracking. The swinging bulb in the flashlight, Vincent sees what
looks like‚Ä¶ Eric's joints are bent the wrong way. His face is hanging‚Ä¶ strangely
off his skull. There's a guttural sound coming from the creature.

Vincent clutches his cross. "Is Eric still within you?"

"Eric is where he's been since that night. This body was buried 3 weeks ago, but
it contained enough mass to climb out."

Footsteps are heard coming behind them. "RPA! We've been following you, come
peacefully!"

Neither Vincent nor Eric knew it, but the RPA had been investigating Eric since
the incident. When they enter, guns drawn, Vincent needs to make a choice: does
he try to "save" "Eric," reasoning with the RPA to spare him and take him alive?
Or does he collaborate with the RPA to take "Eric" down, dead or alive? Either
of these can succeed or fail, even after he's set his intention.

## Notes

Vincent's "riches to rags to riches" story was based on [Desi Arnaz.][5] I've
watched hundreds of hours of _I Love Lucy_ as a kid, was cool getting to pull on
this.

Rejected character ideas include: Rasputin-like old-timey alchemist, very mathey
proto-computer person (still very early for this), Poe Dameron pilot/machinist
type, or the George Smiley "boring-looking master spy."

## Playing Vincent

The group and I concluded the game yesterday, and I (as I usually do!) had a
hard time disengaging from being a reckless smartass, the way many of my
characters do. In more "RP" scenes where I was engaging an NPC, I did the Calm
Loving Priest thing very well, but when deciding how to _engage_ with that
scene, I sometimes let my smart-assery run a little loose.

Towards the end I was able to tap into the strengths of his religion more. He
wasn't good at combat, or wasn't much of a healer either, and rogue-ish
tendencies, but eventually I learned to pilot him a bit better to make use of
his primary stat (Lore).

We barely got out of the final boss, so I might write a scene or two of the Life
After, which we did a bit as a group in the game with [√Ångel][3].
