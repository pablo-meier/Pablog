### New setup

For most of my time working on computers, [I just used my laptop,][1] hunched
over like a gremlin. Then a broken Apple laptop keyboard in quarantine [had me
pulling second-string equipment][2] to more closely resemble a "real setup,"
mostly because using an external keyboard while looking at a laptop monitor a
few feet further away is odd. About a week and a half ago, I did an upgrade,
using my gaming hardware on it:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
  <a href="/img/2020/4/1_old_setup.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/4/1_old_setup_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
</div>

Main differences:

- The mouse is now a gaming mouse; I got a nice one for StarCraft back in 2013.
- Keyboard is the same!
- Monitor is much bigger: I took a month off between ClassPass and Lyft (2017)
  and upgraded my gaming PC; part of that upgrade was a 4K monitor. Turns out
  the Macbook can handle it!
- Got myself a vertical stand for the laptop.
- Snowball microphone: while I prefer the gaming headset, when Karen and I host
  Jackbox games or join social calls, we need an external mic; this is better
  than the webcam one (barely lol), which we had it from a previous art project.

Yesterday, I upgraded again with new hardware: got an adjustable standing desk
and a monitor arm. Here are some build photos, and we're working with now:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2020/4/2_pieces_on_floor.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/4/2_pieces_on_floor_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Lay the pieces on the floor.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">New tabletop</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Getting there‚Ä¶</p>
<a href="/img/2020/4/5_final_setup.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/4/5_final_setup_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">And we got there!</p>
</div>

I've had standing desks at Adobe and Lyft; I've liked them both, it makes it
easier to lean in to my workday, without my energy sinking into a chair with
me. When I've got good music going, I can bounce and dance a bit. That said,
it matters to me that it's adjustable: at some point on most workdays, I get
tired of this and want to sit for an hour or two.

Other costs: by taking all these from my gaming PC, I'm not using it for games
anymore. I experimented with an AV splitter in the past, but with this many
peripherals it can be hard to have a single switch so I can say "use the laptop"
vs. "use the PC."

I've always liked working from home a lot more than going into an office; while
I imagine we'll be forced to stay home for a fair bit longer, I might invest in
this setup with the hope that I don't go to offices five days a week even after
the initial COVID spike.

Future improvements?

- Additional monitors on other arms. I've always wanted a "code-only"
  vertically-aligned monitor. If I turn this massive monitor on it's side ü§§
- At one point I considered a treadmill bottom, so I could walk while working,
  or during meetings. These are‚Ä¶ not cheap (on the order of the desk itself), so
  a bit hard to experiment with. But since I've lost almost all my physical
  activity to the pandemic anyway, I might get desperate enough.
- Going overboard on the A/V for remote meetings or media making. I'm using a
  webcam and either the snowball mic or the gaming headset; a post like [this
  one by Chris Coyier][3] (that links to many others!) do things like use a DSLR
  as a webcam, with additional lighting, and better microphones.

Additionally, using interesting A/V effectively with videoconferencing software 
is a challenge of its own. Even if you have a great mic, if you want to make it
sound professional on Hangouts or Zoom by running it through noise
reducers and compressors, and software for _that_ is a game of its own.

Most of these are significant money sinks, and I'm a tired from yesterday's
build and have a job lol, so there might be some time before I do another chunk
of this.

Also, if we can have [competitive lumberjacking][4] (no shade, it looks cool!)
can we have "competitive cardboard box-breaking for city sanitation codes"? Give
a bunch of dudes a bunch of boxes and see how quickly and well they break them
down? I deserve a medal for the amount of cardboard I did strike for lol.

### Cool video

I saw this a week or two ago, kept the tab open to share. Now I can finally
close it:

### Fire Emblem update

I beat the game this weekend. I married Petra. I started a New Game+, thinking
"alright! Time to play on the hardest difficulty setting," and got wiped the
fuck out, several times, in the second battle. Looks like they heard the
feedback loud and clear: Maddening mode is **not fucking around** and to survive
it [you have to do a lot of counterintuitive things][5] and be more of a
masochist than I am. Back to Hard mode for me; I might give Maddening another
try if I complete this run and do a third.

Also, the romance in this game is _mad_ off-putting given that your avatar didn't
ever present a personality. Byleth legit has the presence of a gym sock, so
hearing a talented voice actor profess their deep and burning love to them is
like watching a good friend have a hallucination: they keep cooing at a dog
they insist is the cutest thing they've ever seen _but you can't see the dog._
idk, I watched the marriage cinematic just felt wrong.

Now it's Golden Deer, with Claude. He's a cutie.
