<small>_ðŸŽµ The song for this post is [MOUTH][9], by Neil Cicierega._</small>

My dad described an essay a friend sent him whose arguments went something along
these lines:

* A prominent man in media who started magazines and had initiatives in the pipeline
  got outed as a creeper via #MeToo, and was fired/removed from his positions.

* But, according to the author, he did (and does) great work! The author thinks
  the rush to condemnation is a result of the cultural weaknesses of millenials,
  who have reduced attention spans and follow outrage instead of valuing
  discourse. Because of this, they likely didn't consider _the true and total
  cost_ of letting a figurehead like this be fired and disgraced.

My dad asked if I had any good thinkpieces to recommend about millenials and
their attention spans, and I told him I'd look for one, or write one. I ended up
writing one! Here's a more edited version of what I wrote back to my dad.

(I'm not linking the piece, I'll say why after at the bottom).

### You're not the first person to think about People

Something I see missing from arguments like those in the piece is
an awareness of social sciences. Thinkpiece authors make salaries stitching
together simple narratives about The Kids without ever acknowledging that there
are people who study questions like these, professionally, in fields that are
peer-reviewed and building on centuries of study and rigor.

Most of the people who write columns like this [defend Liberal Arts
educations][7] but demonstrate no value to attaining one by failing to clarify
their terms or even ask basic questions, like:

* How are we defining "reduced attention spans?" Is it what people consume? If
  so, how do we categorize it as reduced? Is it how _much_ they consume? Is it
  the level of analysis they produce when they respond to it?
* What are the challenges of meaningful comparison with prior generations, given the
  differences in technology?
* Is it the kids who are losing these "attention spans," or everyone who uses
  tech products?
* Is there a good or justifiable reason "attention spans" get shorter?

They instead build on assumptions (I'd argue they more rely on the ambiguities)
and it comes out sounding like "those kids don't focus on Important Things
(conveniently the things I care about) because of their Snap Chats and their
Tweeters and their Face Books." I'm not a social scientist, and my non-STEM
degree was in Music, and I still thought it important to at least acknowledge
questions like the above before getting paid to blame society's ills on the
habits of the most diverse generation of people to reach adulthood (and one that
got [very uniquely fucked][8] at the wealth game).

The other notable omission in these pieces is forgetting that
history exists, and considering their arguments in historical contexts. Namely:
_collectively speaking, every generation tends to think the Kids Aren't
Alright._ "Get off my lawn" is a joke for a reason, and anyone getting mad at
millenials for using apps are probably motivated by the same forces that caused
[Socrates to be against writing.][1] I'm not saying "nobody can criticize apps
or what they do to us" but if you have to make a direct comparison of millenials
to their Better Parents please at least demonstrate that you tried
controlling for bias against people growing up differently than they did.

### A counterexample using the same bad rules

All that being said, referencing whitepapers is nobody's idea of a good time,
and the world runs on simple narratives. So here's one of mine for why it seems
millenials have shorter attention spans, using the same amount of rigor I'm
chastising: it's an adaptation for the amount of information we're presented.

Said with metaphor: it's not that we're less hungry, it's just that there's so
much food all the time that when we finish a meal there are still platters and
platters of entrees on the table, so now we eat differently, too.

The "perfect" Facebook and Twitter consumers are people who spend their whole
lives scrolling feeds (and seeing ads); these companies hire hundreds of smart
people to encourage us to do this. We have pocket supercomputers that deliver
continuous streams of information tailored to our social circles and tastes.
We've enabled anyone with $15 to buy a domain name and be a publisher of news.
If you imagine plate after plate of donuts, salads, steaks, shrimp, ice cream,
kebabs, sandwiches, quiches, and cakes; we still eat our fill, but the plates
remain full. So consumers take more individual bites things than they used to.
They build meals differently. _This is a rational response to our world._

In my experience: this isn't limited to young minds! Older people behave like
this too. And I don't know what past these people remember where general society
ponderously studied _Anna Karenina_ or _Finnegans Wake_ after a hard day at the
plant; I'm willing to bet most people preferred simple consumption then too, you
just didn't have to see them as much or run into them (we still spend most of
our waking lives [watching TV all day,][2] and it was worse pre-Internet).

### All this mental contortion to help an asshat

As for the editor of a journal or whatnot, I just remember the headline: [I
Donâ€™t Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People.][3]
Impacts of predatory behavior are real, and if you don't want to believe a
collective of women that their lives are worse because someone made deliberate,
selfish choices at their expense, there's nothing I can say to convince you to
believe or care for them. And I'll note that folks like the author demand I
treat their opinions respectfully but they can't do it for large numbers of
people who almost always get punished for calling out their experiences.

I'll also point to this great essay, [on how #MeToo isn't so much about sex as
it is about work.][4] We should remember the other effects of predatory men in
the workplace in addition to sexual trauma. Every woman founder I know gets hit
on by VCs, and get offered funding in exchange for dates and sex. This happens
to almost none of the male founders I know. You can't tell me it's a fair 
obstacle to disproportionately put on entrepreneurial women who want to start
companies.

What I suspect is happening, for the author, is illustrated well by [this comic
by Matt Lubchansky at The Nib][5]:

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">
<a href="http://matt.pizza/">Matt</a> is great. You should see
<a href="http://www.listen-tome.com/">his personal comic</a>, and I love
<a href="https://thenib.com/">The Nib</a> generally.</p>
</div>

I'm sure the author feels things have gone a little too far, but is failing at
empathy because, well, their lives are doing pretty well on the whole.

It's common for folks to believe that abuse may be necessary for great work to
exist: it is, unfortunately, one of the prevailing cultural narratives in our
stories. From Tonya Harding's mother in _I, Tonya_ to J.K. Simmon's character
in _Whiplash,_ to Daniel Day-Lewis in _The Phantom Thread,_ to the myth of Steve
Jobs, to _House_â€¦ it's everywhere. I imagine if you're someone who doesn't think
much, it's tempting to think those are an accurate reflection of human output in
the real world.

But it's not. Again, social science. Management theory is super studied,
and it turns out being an abusive asshole, if anything, reduces output of anyone
you're in charge of or around. I don't have to kick my dog to cook a good meal,
and I don't have to be a predator to start a magazine. Kick them out.

### Why I'm not linking it

I found it andâ€¦ it's not worth linking to. Message me if you're really curious,
but I was expecting a more reputable outlet (I'd not heard of this one, it was
started by neocons), has an embarassing website, and most of all, the piece was
published by a junior in college. Her first job was going to be at one of
The Bad Dude's cancelled initiatives, and I think that factors into "what was
lost" (my first gig). It's frankly not worth piling on, and the bullet points my
dad texted me were actually about as deep as it got, with the added benefit of
being shorter.

But I'd already written most of this, so I thought I'd share it anyways.
