I'm immediately suspicious of nostalgia for a thing thing I didn't experience.
I'm always tickled by conservatives on college campuses who talk about Better or
Simpler Times that they weren't alive for. Similarly, we tend to smooth the
edges on things we enjoy being fond of (every time someone famous dies we tend
to overstate their importance and not mention when they were horrible).

I didn't watch _Mr. Roger's Neighborhood_ growing up. I can't say sweet
things about Fred Rogers from a position of authority, and I haven't 
researched him or his show much.

But boy, do I love the projection I have of him. I read [this article][1] today
that reminded me of his narrative:

> The feeling of someone making space for you is pretty rare for most kids. Many
> parents spend far too much of their energy holding forth, correcting, and
> handing down Big Important Lessons that melt into a giant blob of received
> “wisdom.” Or they’re too distracted by their phones or their jobs or their
> endless to-do lists to slow down and leave some empty space for a kid to fill.
> As a parent, sometimes I have to remind myself that even playing games or
> having fun together isn’t the same thing as offering up time for kids to be
> seen and heard clearly. Because when you’re a kid, even good friends mostly
> talk over you and rarely listen. Childhood is [lonelier][2] and more isolating than
> most of us are [willing to remember][3] or admit.

> But then, most people would rather avoid talking about dark emotions like fear,
> anger, melancholy, and longing anyway — a problem Rogers’s show always tried to
> address. And most parents don’t love the idea that children experience a vast
> ocean of emotions beyond happiness, in part because many of us don’t like
> admitting that we all contain volatile seas of rage and despair. Rogers’s quiet
> air of acceptance and love makes us squeamish because it exposes our own
> conflicted, avoidant natures. His silence challenges us to accept our own
> emotional complexity in ways that the whirring, buzzing, flashing simulacrum of
> global culture specifically discourages.

I mentioned when talking about _Avatar: the Last Airbender_ that [the main
mistake children's media makes is that it doesn't take kids seriously.][4] My
working theory is that adults are largely the same people they were as kids,
but as children they have a remarkably small pool of context to draw from.
But they're there! Frequently very clever, curious, and open to new things! And
they appreciate being treated as independent agents and worthy of respect.

(fun fact: some social scientists determine whether someone has authoritarian
preferences [by asking them about child-rearing][6] and what constitutes "good
children")

A few months ago [Twitch hosted a Mr. Rogers marathon][5] and I saw an episode
for the first time. And reader, I cried. Things out there are terrible. It's
easy to be reminded of this when people are profiting massively from devices and
algorithms that profit from our attention, and consequently maximize this profit
by fomenting anger and resentment. Seeing a person who's curious, takes their time,
loves everyone openly, feels sincerely, projecting an image of _we can all just
be good to each other_ was not something I was emotionally prepared for that
afternoon.

So big ups to Fred Rogers. Maybe there's more that makes this
complicated, but I appreciate the impact this had on me.
