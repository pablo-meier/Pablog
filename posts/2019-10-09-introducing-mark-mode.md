I keep hearing about all these websites offering a "Mark mode" for their users,
and after thinking about it hard enough, I finally did the same thing. So check
it out! Now, from any page, you can run `markMode()` from the JavaScript console
to experience <strong>More Pablo</strong> in glorious Mark Mode!

Alternatively, press this button to see it here!

<button id="markActivate" style="margin: 15px auto;">MARK MODE</button>

JavaScript is required, sorry non-JS friends ðŸ˜¢

For _no reason at all_, here's the "I" chapter from _Eunoia_ by Christian Bok:

> Writing is inhibiting. Sighing, I sit, scribbling in ink
> this pidgin script. I sing with nihilistic witticism,
> disciplining signs with trifling gimmicks â€” impish
> hijinks which highlight stick sigils. Isnâ€™t it glib?
> Isnâ€™t it chic? I fit childish insights within rigid limits,
> writing shtick which might instill priggish misgiv-
> ings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nit-
> picking criticism which flirts with philistinism. I
> bitch; I kibitz â€” griping whilst criticizing dimwits,
> sniping whilst indicting nitwits, dismissing simplis-
> tic thinking, in which philippic wit is still illicit.
>
> Pilgrims, digging in shifts, dig till midnight in mining
> pits, chipping flint with picks, drilling schist with drills,
> striking it rich mining zinc. Irish firms, hiring micks
> whilst firing Brits, bring in smiths with mining skills:
> kilnwrights grilling brick in brickkilns, millwrights
> grinding grist in gristmills. Irish tinsmiths, fiddling
> with widgits, fix this rig, driving its drills which spin
> whirring drillbits. I pitch in, fixing things. I rig this
> winch with its wiring; I fit this drill with its piping. I
> dig this ditch, filling bins with dirt, piling it high, sift-
> ing it, till I find bright prisms twinkling with glitz.
