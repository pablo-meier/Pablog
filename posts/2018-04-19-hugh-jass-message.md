    og_description: A small project to troll your friends.

Unbelievably, I followed through on a threat to do a project the other day. I
present to you [hughjassmessage.com][1].

What is it? A clone of [bigassmessage.com][2], correctly dubbed "the most useful
site on the Internet." I use(d) it all the time to to send links [like these][3]
to my friends. It's a bit like [Let Me Google That For You][4] ([example][5]) in
that it's a troll-ish and fun wrapper around messages you might want to
send your friends.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2018/4/hjm.png" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2018/4/hjm_THUMB.png" alt="a Huge Ass Message. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</a>
</div>

Why clone it? Because I love it, while also having a few critiques:

* It's backend isn't always up. Often (like, as I'm typing this) I'm unable to
  create new Big-Ass Messages.

* Load time: according to its author, people have submitted tens of millions of
  messages! This is cool! But the underlying datastore is taking a bit longer to
  fetch them from the URL hashes, so when you load a message, you're greeted by
  a placeholder "BIG-ASS MESSAGE," which removes the initial shock (and
  therefore, fun!) of sending this to your friends.

* Querystring option: like Let Me Google That For You, I felt like it would be
  handy to generate a link without having to make a call to a specific
  datastore. I might add proper short IDs like BAM does, but right now you can
  call it with either `q=<MESSAGE>` in plaintext, or `r=<MESSAGE>` for
  [rot13.][6]

* Obscured URLs: if you ask someone to click a url called `bigassmessage.com`,
  there's a bit less surprise in what they're getting. So while I have both
  [hughjassmessage.com][1] and [hugeassmessage.com][7], generated URLs point to
  `hjm.wtf`, so your friends won't see it coming until it hits them.

### Behind the scenes

In a case of _massive overkill_, I used [Phoenix][8] for this, and am hosting it
on a [LightSail][9] instance. It doesn't have a datastore yet, but I might put
SQLite behind it and push backups to S3.

It's The World's Simplest App: the [embiggening][13] of the text happens
with client-side JavaScript, so without a datastore, this app is pretty much a
single static file + rot13. So why use Phoenix? A few reasons, but the main one
is that I'd like to commit to finally learning a full-featured framework for
once. My work at companies has put me on microframeworks like [Express][15] and
[Flask][14], which certainly make it easy to host an endpoint, but you _always_
end up writing a ton of middleware (input validation, logging, asset minification,
etc.) and I would love to be surrounded by something with _opinions_, finally.

[Dropwizard][16] was a favorite for a while, but even it makes certain basic
things hard, and I'm not feeling in a Java mood recently.

I find Elixir strange. That will pass, but its syntax is a bit sugary for
my tastes. I'm finding tools like [Distillery][11], [Mix][10], and [Hex][12]
delightful to use.

[Let's Encrypt][18] is _such_ a blessing.

I avoided Docker. It's a small personal project, so it's a ["pets, not
cattle"][19] model: if I lose the instance, I'd have to manually re-install
Elixir, nginx, and the like. You don't need city food inspectors in your
personal kitchen when cooking yourself dinner, and so your stuff probably
doesn't need anything more than a pet server anyway ðŸ˜›
