College roommate, best friend, and very handsome bison [Saurya][1] is blogging,
and he [has a post][2] about rising and falling on macro scales:

> Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, PM of the UAE and emir of Dubai was once
> quoted saying:
> 
> > My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my
> > son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will
> > ride a camel
> 
> And in a somewhat similar vein, Einstein was once quoted as saying:
>
> > I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV
> > will be fought with sticks and stones.
>
> And in another, somewhat similar vein, a German politician recently said:
>
> > In Germany, it is expected that the plumberâ€™s taxes pay for a doctorâ€™s
> > education. The plumber is the parent and the medical student is the child.

and offers some thoughts about how this is or isn't related to historical "rises
and falls" of culture, cities, and civilizations:

> However, Al Maktoumâ€™s prediction is probably going to apply to many regions of
> the world that are currently seeing a boom. This is in some ways just the
> rhythm of things - rise and fall. A great visualization of this charts the
> trajectory of the worldâ€™s 10 most populous cities over the past 500 years. The
> cities falling off the chart are not just slowing down in their growth - they
> are shrinking. If youâ€™re not growing, youâ€™re shrinking.

This reminds me of an interesting frame I hadn't considered from _Superior: The
Return of Race Science_, which [I read last year][16]: I forget how it's
mentioned, but if you consider a culture or civilization's _longevity_ and
sustainability, indigenous ones tend to blow non-indigenous ones out of the
water. It's a messy observation that I could probably define better with a bit
more thought and/or conversations with professionals ("White Europeans are still
around, man." "Yeah, but like, Rome or the British Empire aren't."), but there's
something to the fact that native cultures that don't get disrupted tend to
stick around, and that's maybe a feature and not a bug?

My freshman roommate was from Greece and we had a few chats about this â€” he was
pretty Euro-centric, though I think this is a common belief â€” but at least _his_
idea was (simplified) "Europeans, because [REASON], had guns, germs, and steel,
which the natives didn't. If the natives had discovered/invented them, the
shape of history would look somewhat similar (winners and losers, depleting
planetary resources, conquest and colonialism) but the cast would look a little
browner, and the names/shapes of the territories would have changed." The
[REASON], depending if you're talking to a conservative or a racist, is "White
people were better at [thing]," whereas classical liberals attribute it more to
circumstance.

This feels like giving colonialists a bit of a pass? "Any group of humans with
sufficient power would have been brutal groups of colonialists in the same way
we were." I don't feel comfortable assuming that? We have [so many different
dimensions of observed human cultures][3], I'd be surprised if it was shaped the
same way. Or hell, maybe they would have wrought larger, more creative horrors!
We'll never really know: beyond the futility of predicting alternate histories,
we murdered most of them while it was happening and burned their records. Cue an
actual "this is what they took from us" ðŸ™ƒ

idk, there are smarter people who study these things.

## All Companies Are Bastards

If you're following tech news, you'll see [DHH is in a snowball fight with
Apple][11] for being shitty corporate monopolists. If you've spent too much of
your precious life following tech personalities, this story has _layers_: DHH
was always flippant about Apple criticism; I think it's safe to call him a
fanboy, and now the leopards are eating his face.

Remember when we all hated Microsoft? Those were the days, man. Can't find the
tweet (maybe deleted? deleting old tweets is prudent) but Gary
Bernhardt once tweeted something like "Telling 2004 me that in 201x I don't like
Linus Torvalds, and I like things Microsoft is doing with open source. I punch
the floor so hard my screensaver deactivates." (referencing [this][4]). Anyway,
Microsoft _was_ terrible!

And remember Google? Don't be evil? Before they [gave a guy $90m to leave after
sexually harassing people?][5] How their Chief Legal Officer [had affairs with
numerous employees][6] and treated one, having his child, [like shit after
firing her?][8] How [they retaliated against walkout organizers?][7]

Anyway, all these companies are garbage. I wish we had alternatives. I mean, we
_do_, kinda, but they're a massive pain in the ass to operate in and migrate to.
Speaking ofâ€¦

## IndieWeb

IndieWeb sounds like it'd fit this blog's aesthetic, right? Like, my
[self-hosted bullshit][12] and [making the Web an actual web][13] of content,
for and by humans. But I'm having trouble getting on board? Not on any of its
goals, mind you: I dig the ideals well enough. I'm just a little burned out by
this being the <em>n</em>th iteration of it. I sat through arguments for
Structured Web and HTML vs. XHTML (make sure it passes validators!) and Semantic
HTML vs. Presentational. I saw Apple, one of the most proprietary and secretive
companies in tech, argue with a straight face (and people believed it!) that
Flash being closed-source was a major problem, while not letting anyone else
create a rendering engine for iOS. I'm watching AMP take over, and it just
reminds me of every other attempt that fits the lines of "if we all hold hands
and do the right thing, the Internet can be saved from the wealth hoarders,
become open, and be a resource to humanity!" and see it get utterly steamrolled
by SV companies, and fail to catch hold with anyone you'd care to read.

Like hobbyists with ham radios, it won't go away entirely (thank God), butâ€¦
it'll only be populated by the kind of people who hang out on ham radios. Which,
no offense! It seems like a cool hobby, but in the case of ham radios, it's
literally nobody I know, and at least the ham radio people probably participate
more broadly in society to a degree that moving completely off of Tech Monopoly
platforms wouldn't allow (check out [Kashmir Hill's series of trying to cut out
big tech][9], one company at a time. She has her phone pointed to a VPN that
blacklist AWS IPs during the Amazon chapter, for instance. You can guess how
that went).

I guess I'm thinking of my experience [hosting a Pleroma instance][14] and
trying to get into The Fediverse. Maybe I'm using it wrong? Maybe I haven't
found the right people to follow, even a year after setting it up? idk, if you
take the journalists and comedians and speedrunners/competitive gamers I follow
on Twitter away, what you're left with isâ€¦ not a service I enjoy using very
often? Some of the memes are better, but mostly, it's not fun or miserable the
way Twitter is both.

On another note, I'm not sure federation is the answer. It's better than a
private, unprofitable centralized company for sure, but could we build truly
decentralized systems? BitTorrent is _fucking amazing_ for how to move lots
of data around efficiently, but it has very little use in casual computing via
private companies.

I get depressed sometimes for what we did to the Internet. We could have kept
building interoperable protocols like Email and RSS (I was at Google when Sergey
mocked an employee's concern for the Open Web at a TGIF when Calendar removed
CalDAV support), we could have demanded better from the companies that became
giants, but we cashed out checks and destroyed it, one commit at a time. 

Anyway: I might implement WebMention or hCard or any of these other things. And
if you know of a good alternative (ideally server-side, self-hosted) for Google
Calendar or Contacts, hit me up. I played with [EteSync][10] this weekend and
it'sâ€¦ a bit of an odd duck, not quite what I'm after, I think.

Also, [this post][15] and the idea of a "directory" is pretty solid. I'll put
one here, and a proper blogroll at some point.
