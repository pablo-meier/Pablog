I've been living in Philadelphia now for about a month, and I'm very impressed
with the murals in the city. Most city art projects are small-scale,
unobtrusive, and extremely tepid.

While Philly's murals aren't GROUNDBREAKING ART, they're certainly very
beautiful, and all over. Here are six of them within a half-mile of my
apartment:

This one is across from [Green Eggs Cafe][1] on 13th St. Good to have since
waits for brunch can be ridiculous.

<img src="/img/2013/12/philly-magic-gardens.jpg" alt="Entrace to Philly Magic Gardens" style="margin: 15px auto;" />

This is the entrance to [Philadelphia's Magic Gardens][2], and apparently a
popular wedding spot.

<img src="/img/2013/12/animal-shelter.jpg" alt="Morriss Animal Refuge" style="margin: 15px auto;" />

Appropriately painted on the side of the [Morriss Animal Refuge][3].

<img src="/img/2013/12/across-apartment.jpg" alt="Across my apartment." style="margin: 15px auto;" />

This one's across my apartment building. Especially fun since parts of it stick
out of the building.

<img src="/img/2013/12/parking-lot.jpg" alt="Mural on parking lot." style="margin: 15px auto;" />

At a parking lot... I think on Spruce St., but I could be wrong.

<img src="/img/2013/12/pride-in-philly.jpg" alt="Philly Pride" style="margin: 15px auto;" />

This one celebrates Pride in Philly.

More of them on TIME [here][5]. See also the [Mural Arts Program][6], or [Mural Tours][7].
