<small>_🎵 The song for this post is [Motownphilly][12], by Boyz II Men._</small>

If you asked my Adobe and Google co-workers about Paul Meier, they'd probably
tell you about a mousy kid who interviewed well, didn't ask for help enough, and
largely avoided them at lunch. I nearly quit the industry after my Google year:
I'd never really reckoned with the pain of [my sister's medical emergency][13],
and my depression hit the worst I'd ever known it. During my first two jobs, I
shrank myself to be as small as I could.

A lot changed after moving East such that I started being more healthy,
functional, and openly myself. It's still a process. Coworkers here know me more
as Pablo, I don't avoid them, and they see a few things I do to make work/code
a bit more fun. I invite you to steal these! Alternatively, create new ones,
and/or share favorites in the comments!

### Song of the PR

**What to do:** Add a song link to your PRs!

It could be for how you're feeling that day, how you feel about the bug you're
fixing, that repo you're entering for the first time, or a song/genre you'd
like to expose to your co-workers.

**History:** This one is popular enough I brought it to the blog, and I suspect
it came from the "current song" fields in LiveJournal. The first one
was [Chamillionaire's _Ridin'_][1], while at Reonomy.<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

### README gifs

<video autoplay="true" loop="true" src="/img/2018/2/milestones.mp4" style="margin: 5px auto; display: block"></video>
<p style="font-style: italics; font-size: small; text-align: center">This is the
README gif I used for ClassPass' "milestones" service.</p>

**What to do:** Place a gif at the top of your repo's `README.md`.

Since [every company I worked at moved to multiple services][3], this meant a
proliferation of repositories and folks visiting them. Adding gifs generally
gets a giggle from folks and make your code just a little more welcoming.

### Printing banners

**What to do:** When your service/code starts, print a dope banner.

**Example:** When you start ScreamChess, a collaborative art project a few
friends and I worked on last summer, it prints:

similarly, when you start the Content Management API at ClassPass, you're
greeted with:

**History:** Really, this has always been fun, but I started doing it more
insistently and universally after using [Dropwizard][5] at companies, which
[explicitly lists this as a feature][4].

You should _probably_ have a `--quiet` option to suppress this, since [even
printing a joke to standard error apparently introduces bugs.][6]

### Easter eggs

**What to do:** If your company is small enough, spend an afternoon adding an
Easter Egg somewhere in your code.

**Example:** Open your web console (directions for [Firefox][7], [Chrome][8]) on
this page!

**History:** This started at [Sup][11], where I'd built and maintained the Android
app entirely on my own. I was ahead of schedule on our next release, and on my
birthday decided to treat myself. Since we had controllable directions as part
of the product ("left", "right", "down", etc) I programmed [the Konami Code][9]
into the app, which if you did, printed ["ZERG RUSH"][10] and a bunch of little
Pablo heads invaded the app. Here's me testing it:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2018/2/zerg_rush.jpg" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2018/2/zerg_rush_THUMB.jpg" alt="Pablo testing the zerg rush Easter egg. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</a>
</div>

### "Comrades!"

**What to do:** Call people your comrades! Or, really, something fun. And
gender-neutral!

**History:** This started in college: the CS course websites are built and run
by undergrad TA's and usually themed for fun. Here's [the course that taught me
programming][17], here's [the one that taught me systems][18]. Go to the staff
pages and hover over the images!

So when I was a UTA for Databases, I skinned our site to be Revolutionary. I
photoshopped the TAs and professors to be Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. I
emailed our students with "Comrades!"

Sadly that one is lost to the ethers of the Internet. I later re-skinned it more
to my professor's liking: bluegrass music:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2018/2/bluegrass_databases.png" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2018/2/bluegrass_databases_THUMB.png" alt="Databases and bluegrass, together at last. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</a>
</div>

My professor and I bonded over bluegrass 😊

### Fun job title ("Flossing Enthusiast")

**What to do:** Give yourself an obscure hobby or interest and parade it. Mine
is usually related to flossing. It's been on [my Twitter bio and header
image][15] for years, and for a while was on my GitHub profile.

**History:** Oddly, I really can't remember how this one started. I used to use
say variations of "I breed prizewinning clams" [from this very old joke
essay][14], and think this came out of that line of humor.

The best thing to come out of this was a recruiter email I got:

> Hey Pablo,
>
> Since you love flossing so much, would you be interested in [COMPANY] if we
> offered you a whole box of dental floss? 

All said, titles are meaningless but they also heavily impact your career. Have
a bit of fun with them if you have to deal with them.

My coworker, [Memo Sanchez][2], got a great laugh out of it, and I credit that
reaction for its continuing to be a thing.
