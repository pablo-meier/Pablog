### The Messenger: Picnic Panic!

I've learned that many of the games [I've written about][8] and dedicated significant
time to are pretty Basic Bitch-level in the indie game scene (_Celeste_ and
_Hollow Knight_ are massively known and loved?!); I mostly know this by how
few people comparably played and/or were moved by _The Messenger_: I added it to
my followed games on Twitch and frequently see nobody playing it, I mentioned it
in chat watching a Hollow Knight speedrunning stream and the streamer had only
vaguely had heard of it.

I am very sorry to have learned this! In my initial review I think I shortsold
it a bit: I've played it 2-3 times over again, have come to really appreciate
the design of the game more and more (especially everyone's favorite parts, the
linear 8-bit section) and have _really_ become attached to
[Rainbowdragoneyes's soundtrack,][9] which has powered most of the Value I've
produced selling my labor to companies.

So before talking about _Picnic Panic_, let me re-state the obvious: _The
Messenger_ is very good! I also enjoyed reading about [how much the developers
were able to squeeze out of the cloudstep mechanic][1].

So, _Picnic Panic_: It's a welcome addition! I've read others say that it gives
you more of what _The Messenger_ does best, with more linear sections and
challenging platforming, which I think is about accurate, but it's not the whole
story.

It's true that those parts are my favorite, are there, and are fantastic. The
totem boss fight is fun, the "race" section works very well, and the
"reward" for the optional collectibles (from both a gameplay section and a story
flavor one) is delightful.

But a lot of this DLC is composed of some brand-new sections, which I'm glad to
have but didn't love as much. Like _The Messenger_ itself, the devs
had a lot of fun squeezing a lot of different things into this game, and it's hard to
imagine the player who loves all of them, all the time, equally. I'm thinking of
the surfboard minigame, the racing section (which worked for me!) and the final
boss.

My big crusade these days is that we should have more obviously-human things in
our lives: the media we consume, the internet we "surf," the writing we read and
produce. In order for the capitalists to keep squeezing more blood from the
stone, everything is targeting Ôº≥Ôº£Ôº°Ôº¨Ôº•‚Ñ¢ and consolidating, making so much of
life taste like a bland, mass-produced paste unless you work to counteract it.

Not every part of _Picnic Panic_ worked for me, but like _The Messenger_ core
game, the whole thing drips with humanity and is obviously made by a group of
talented, creative humans who are having fun.

<h3 id="farewell">Celeste: Farewell</h3>

</div>

Anyone who follows my online presence can see that _Celeste_ really got me,
harder than most other works in any medium for the last 10 years. With that in
mind, it's very hard to live up to expectations, and a lot of creators
(rationally!) panic pretty hard when something becomes a breakaway success. In
my observation, they end up releasing a follow-up that gets praised a little
more than I would have, that often commits less hard in any specific direction
(think _Us_ after _Get Out_, or _Gentleman_ after _Gangnam Style_, or _The
Witness_ after _Braid_‚Ä¶). Luckily, _Farewell_ is great!

I'll throw spoilers going forward, so be warned.

My immediate feeling isn't to drip praise effusively; I feel like one of the new
mechanics (the jellyfish glider) falls into the category
of _Celeste_ mechanics that are frustratingly hard to get even a functional grasp
of. While "there's no RNG in _Celeste_" is a frequent talking point, certain
mechanics (the squid [Seekers][10] in the Mirror Temple, [Core Lava blocks][11])
introduce a level of chaos or have such a precise requirement for
controlling them that they make casual play a less fun kind of challenging.

Other mechanics work great! The [a'splosion fish,][12] once I got how they worked,
allowed for some delightful obstacle courses. After so much practice in the rest
of the game, the last screen made me feel a way I didn't think I'd feel again:
that first time you see a screen and think "Holy God‚Ä¶ how even?!"

(more spoilers! really, I mean it!)

Thematically, Chapter 9 fits in beautifully. I guessed from the title some of
what the "hook" would be (tbh I thought it'd be Madeline mourning Theo, I'm glad
it wasn't), but while the first game was about coming to grips with anxiety
and/or depression, exploring grief (especially for a person who can really hit a
rock bottom) is heartwarming to see. Even the final shots where you see
Madeline's bedroom, with meds on the bedstand and little queer support flags by
her computer, just radiates empathy.

I love that the hardest obstacles live in Madeline's head. I also love that,
Some Time After the core reconciliation of the original game, Madeline and
Badeline got to reverse who could comfort who. Badeline's
line in Chapter 2 "I'm the pragmatic part [of you]" hints at something I think is
hard to articulate: a lot of getting "caught up in your head" about depression
and anxiety is a very smart, clever, and capable part of you _that is frequently
right and helpful._ Badeline never has a character-breaking "it's okay to be
scared"-type moment for Madeline, but she is supporting her, and there is a
sense that they're not in this alone, and that the work of the first game
carries forward.

The soundtrack goes bold, too, and demonstrates growth and progression. It took
me some time to love the violins, but I have. I think part of my stress with
them was the challenge of the game üòÖ. The composer [wrote something I loved][7],
when thinking about its differences from the core soundtrack:

> It's been an intimidating prospect, to return to the world of Celeste for one
> more outing. The original soundtrack releases saw so much love from thousands
> of people, and so it seemed like an impossible task to follow it up with
> something new. It was only through creating something different, and adding to
> the existing sound of the game, that I felt comfortable telling one more story
> for these characters and world.
>
> Celeste opened doors for me that I've already stepped through, and my
> professional life is wholly different as a result. There's no real denying that
> it's created change for everything that is yet to come for me, and so it only
> made sense that I'd conclude Celeste by changing it, too. The soundtrack to
> Farewell might be off-putting on first listen, and I don't know if people will
> like it less, as much, or more than what I wrote first. It's impossible to live
> up to high expectations, so I did what I always do: try to stay true to what
> kind of story I want to express, and what emotions that brings out. I hope that
> worked.

I think this is an incredibly thoughtful and mature way to approach the
"what now?" of a breakaway success. She also [wrote a delightful
behind-the-scenes.][6]

Anyways, I loved the feeling of new challenges and levels. I'll probably install
[Everest][2] at some point (or move on to Kaizo Mario romhacks, like [Grand Poo
World][3] or [Ninja World 2][4], which [I got to watch the other day][5]).

But first, a break.
