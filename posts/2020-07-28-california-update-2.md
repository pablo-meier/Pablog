I had two other blog posts ready, but then my computer crashed and I
deleted the `.swp` of my drafts file out of habit. So we won't hear about
obscure language paradigms and/or testing, we're just going to talk about me for
a second, which seems to be what the people like anyways lol.

I'm [still in California.][2] We've gone kayaking, seen sea lions and otters,
gone hiking, and had a few meals with nice vistas. Those are the high points —
in my day-to-day, my productivity and comfort in personal and professional
initiatives feels pretty disrupted and I don't love it. One way
you know tech is a rich subset of millenials is how little I see "my fucking
roommate" subtweets, ostensibly because we have so much choice in housing and
many of us live in 1BR apartments. A comedian friend had a set about his
roommates that started with "when you find your roommates on Craigslist, the only
thing you mutually agree on is that you'd like to live indoors," and
while the three of us joining our bubbles agree on a lot more than that, there
was a few days of adjustment and a lot of wincing involved until we cleared
some air this weekend. It's great having a new energy, it sucks having a new
energy.

I often think about [articles that talk about how hard it is to make friends][3]
as adults. One asked "when was the last time you made a new good friend?" and
most of us come out a bit sad for long ago that was. Some research suggests
that _spontaneous, regular contact_ is a requirement for this. Where you and
others are in proximity, frequently, but not because you deliberately decided to
hang out.  This is why environments like school and college tend to produce
amazing friendships. Work can do this too, especially young companies, but
outside these main areas, modern adult life doens't have these spaces.

Except, maybe, roommates! My answer to the "made a new friend" question is the
last person Karen and I lived with. That guy's a fucking prince. When we moved
to Cichlidia our apartment didn't hold another roommate very well. Before him,
though? Real long stretch lol.

So I had some roommate drama last week, it wasn't easy to resolve, and we
understand each other a whole lot better now. One surprising finding was
how much I missed the "coming to understand someone" energy that this kind of
conflict generates? It feels like deepening a friendship. There's a story about
how many of the more "man-made" flat-faced dog breeds (frenchies, bulldogs,
pugs) [_enjoy_ having a breathing tube inserted][1] for surgery, because it's
their lungs reacting to appropriate amounts of oxygen for the first time. "Oh,
_this_ is breathing!?!" This roommate conflict, while not what I wanted in a
pandemic and my normal brain bullshit, had a bit of that feeling, and it's
pretty satisfying.

### Nostalgia

I really liked [this post by John Scalzi][4], on nostalgia for multiple eras.

Formative memories are powerful! I think about nostalgia a lot, mostly because I
really don't feel it the way I think others do. Like, sure, I stopped learning
lyrics to songs after a certain age, but I don't look back at time periods with
a whole lot of happiness, so I don't romanticize the aesthetics of them either?

A big example is college. By many measures, my college experience was fantastic.
But I struggled, man. I've been suicidal since I was 10 and without the family
and home structure that was smothering in how all-encompassing it was (as well
as [effectively losing a family member][5]), that shit was largely a survival
game. I think of what opportunities I had and feel sad at how little I
participated, what a wounded animal I was during it. There were upsides: I went
from knowing nothing about computers to knowing a few things (and most
importantly for interviewing, [learning to talk a big game][6]) but the guy in
my memory — living in his head like I did — it was miserable. So if I hear music
or see photos from that era, I'm not exactly lighting up lol.

I'm feeling more whole these days. It's stupid, but if I could have told
myself "sleep, drink water, and get back into fitness" I suspect a lot of my
memories would look very different. Then again, maybe not.

Also: "find a psychotherapist!"

(speaking of nostalgia, I thought [this song guessing game][7] was super fun.
Part of a greater project to [define the 90's music canon][8]). 

### Psychoanalysis

I'm on a bit of a break from my therapist: I'm really not "on the brink" or
having attacks like I used to, and since he's my largest regular expense after
rent, he was cool when I suggested speaking less.

I've seen a few therapists before this. One guy at Brown from their mental
health services, he sucked ass and clearly served to be a paper trail
if they had to kick me out, what a fucking tool. The next was at Google when I
was suicidal there: she was trained as a marriage and family therapist, who
was super empathetic and had a lot of hands-on "tools" to get you back on your
feet (a daily log of your "victories," for instance). I think her style was more
in line with CBT? Because I was only allowed to have 10 sessions lol.

It was later, after blowing up my life and moving to NYC that I got connected to
my current guy Ed The Golfer, who I don't trust because _who the fuck enjoys
golf?! Douchebags, that's who._ He's a psychoanalyst and I find this much more
suits my style. My favorite article on the differences is [this one][9]:

> CBT embodies a very specific view of painful emotions: that they’re primarily
> something to be eliminated, or failing that, made tolerable. A condition such
> as depression, then, is a bit like a cancerous tumour: sure, it might be
> useful to figure out where it came from – but it’s far more important to get
> rid of it. CBT doesn’t exactly claim that happiness is easy, but it does imply
> that it’s relatively simple: your distress is caused by your irrational
> beliefs, and it’s within your power to seize hold of those beliefs and change
> them.
>
> Psychoanalysts contend that things are much more complicated. For one thing,
> psychological pain needs first not to be eliminated, but understood. From this
> perspective, depression is less like a tumour and more like a stabbing pain in
> your abdomen: it’s telling you something, and you need to find out what. (No
> responsible GP would just pump you with painkillers and send you home.) And
> happiness – if such a thing is even achievable – is a much murkier matter. We
> don’t really know our own minds, and we often have powerful motives for
> keeping things that way. We see life through the lens of our earliest
> relationships, though we usually don’t realise it; we want contradictory
> things; and change is slow and hard.

I've called Ed out on his bullshit a lot, and criticisms against psychoanalysis
also resonate with me, but I've also found a lot of value in it. It's impossible
to find a good therapist and insurance companies psychoanalysts, but if you've
not felt a good hit with other approaches and you have the means to seek it out,
you might like this one.
