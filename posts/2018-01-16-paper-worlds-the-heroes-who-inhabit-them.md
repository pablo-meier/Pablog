\[Spoilers for _Ender's Game_, _The Shape of Things_, _Breaking Bad_, and maybe
_Atlas Shrugged_, I guess? I love approaching things fresh, so if you're hoping
to consume any of 👆🏼 I recommend you [don't read this.][3] Also, it might just
be boring if you've read none of them\]

One of my favorite examples of the blog post as a form is [What I think about
Atlas Shrugged][1], by [John Scalzi][7]. It's also one of my favorite critiques
of the novel and most things Objectivists say in general. Read it, it'll take
you 5 or 10 minutes.

The central conceit is that _Atlas Shrugged_ is fine and fun pulpy fiction, but
it's critical to remember that the world those characters inhabit has
no bearing to this one. In that world, Good People are attractive, have strong
features, and are brilliant; Bad People are obnoxious, mealy, lazy shitheels.
When John Galt condemns a society to collapse (presumably leaving millions to
suffer and die), he's a hero! But in any possible world, someone who allows
millions to die to make a belabored political point isn't someone you should
celebrate.

Scalzi points out:

> The fact that apparently a very large number of people don’t recognize Galt as
> the genocidal prick he is suggests [...] Rand’s skill at stacking the
> story-telling deck is not to be discounted

It's pretty critical, when you consider fictional heroes or their heroism, to
ask how carefully and thoroughly the world was constructed to allow you to feel
this way _despite_ the outcome and their actions instead of because of them.

With that in mind, ["Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and
Morality"][2] is suddenly one of my favorite critiques of the novel. I read
_Ender's Game_ for the first time last summer and had a largely positive
reaction to it, but came away feeling that I was way less sympathetic to its 
characters than many of the book's fans, and this essay articulates why pretty
well.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

Another example is _Breaking Bad._ I had a friend who watched it late, knowing
its strong reputation but also sensitive to [its legions of toxic, sexist
fans][4]. Even in Season 1, she was immediately put off by Walt: how damaging
his lies were, and how emotionally abusive he was. Earlier adopters of the show
didn't feel this _en masse_ in part because [the show's writers deliberately
engineer the dialogue and cinematography][5] of early seasons to make him sympathetic.
Unless you're critical from the very start, all his lies and manipulation are
_understandable_, you see.

My final, maybe favorite example of this is _The Shape of Things_. For most of
the play, you really don't know what you're watching. There's conflict in the
scenes, so they move like scenes in a play should, but most people go to Intermission
mildly uncomfortable without knowing why. By the end of the play its purpose
becomes clear, and if you're an actor looking to practice text analysis, it's a
fabulous script: _every detail_ of every scene is adding another domino to an
extremely impressive domino tipping, while not looking like setting dominos.

I get a lot of joy in thinking about writing prompts, so here's one: pick an
absolutely unforgiveable action, make that the climax, and spent a whole book
trying to make it seem possible, even defensible.

The _real_ further reading is any of the links in the previous section. But
here's some miscellanea:

- Someone wrote up the experience of [browsing the Objectivists Dating Site][8],
  where [one of my obsessions, PIZZA TOMB][9] comes from.

- I enjoyed _Breaking Bad_ a lot, and [wrote about its finale after it
  aired.][6] I'm now very Team _Better Call Saul._ Season 2 contained some
  flatness, but on the whole it's a much better show.

I found the essay in [this Twitter nerd fight][11] between Noah Berlatsky (who
started it by plugging [his essay on it][10], which is a bit stronger on Card
than where I end up) and Akiva Cohen, where the two fight over whether the book
celebrates the xenocide. Arthur Chu has [a ton of other thoughts][12] going
farther into where Card took the series after the first book.
