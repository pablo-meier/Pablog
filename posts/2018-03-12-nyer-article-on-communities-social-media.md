    og_description: Don't say "there are no good solutions," there are.

<small><em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmUsHH5lxsA">Trisection</a>, from the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack, composed by Masaharu Iwata and Hitoshi Sakimoto.</em></small>

I really loved [this piece on social media and toxic communities][1] by Andrew
Marantz in _The New Yorker._ Any piece that connects the dots between Zuck
saying

> "The idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount
> of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy
> idea"

with the fact that Facebook [did research, nonconsensually, to demonstrate
precisely this in 2012][2], deserves a shout-out. My main quibble is with
this transition line, emphasis mine:

> Trolls set a cunning trap. By ignoring their provocations, you risk seeming
> complicit. By responding, you amplify their message. Trump, perhaps the
> world’s most skilled troll, can get attention whenever he wants, simply by

There are only "no solutions to this problem" if you maintain some of the
unspoken constraints they're operating under. Remove the constraints, and you
suddenly have extremely good solutions.

### Maximize short-term revenue and profit for the top, whatever the cost.

There's a cost and revenue side of this directive.

From the cost side: one could hire, incentivize, or empower moderators who can
enforce community standards. _But Pablo! That won't scale!_ I don't know,
Facebook made [$40b in revenue last year][3]. While it costs good money to run
those datacenters and fill Menlo Park with Vitamin Water, I'm pretty sure there's
enough extra revenue there to throw some money at the problem (especially if you
look at executive salaries!). But it would be sizeable money, and they're
currently getting away with spending minimally.

From the revenue side, if gullible Republicans who buy Alex Jones' colloided
silver leave the platform because their lies and paranoia aren't rewarded and
centered, that's fewer users looking at Facebook ads, so they don't want to say
no to that sweet, sweet revenue, even if they participate in our century's
version of internment camps.

If you're interested in healthy online communities, **there's no substitute for
leadership and the hard work of community management.** We've known this for as
long as online communities have existed. But Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter
aren't in the business of healthy online communities, they sell ads. Investment
in making this happen will raise costs and lower some revenue, which they will
never let happen unless they're existentially threatened.

The sad thing is, it would probably generate more total value in the long run,
for many firms, if enough companies kept a mind for overall social and user
health. Our financial structures don't incentivize this. Incidentally, if you're
not familiar with the parable of the paperclip maximizer, [check it out, it's
relevant][4].

### Don't alienate people who historically get everything centered around them at the expense of others

This directive is harder to talk about in brass tacks, but I firmly believe it's
a factor: well-intentioned powerful people get _sad_ when underprivileged people 
are oppressed, but they _panic_ when privileged people lose some of
their status. Remember when the Tea Party stormed Republican Town Halls? It was
effective in part because the people who showed up were old, White Boomers.
We've had protests for Black people getting murdered by cops who were found to
be lying; we've had West Virginia teachers do a state-wide strike, and none of
them shaped our politics the way old White people yelling at Town Halls has.

Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and the rest could enact stronger policies, and
there's a short-term, narrow-minded business case they could make for this. But
I believe part of their reticence to do anything substantial is discomfort when
people who are too different from them start influencing their spaces, and
similar discomfort when people who look like them start losing status.

So again, loved the article! But just like one of my favorite _Onion_ headlines:

> [Scientists Politely Remind World That Clean Energy Technology Ready To Go
> Whenever][5]

We should push back on the narrative that "there are no good solutions to this."
There are! You just have to pull some heads out of some asses, first.
