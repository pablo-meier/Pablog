    og_description: Read an article on "Adventure games," reflect on why they never stuck with me.

### Adventure games

I never played "Adventure games" when they were really a thing, and doubt most
people in my generation even know what they refer to: for a genre called
"Adventure," it's oddly passive! Point-and-click "stories" where you track
inventory, get clues from dialogue, and make liberal use strange objects to
solve puzzles. The ur-game of this is _Myst_, which I suppose everybody played,
but others that get a lot of love are _Monkey Island_, _Dragon Quest_, and _Grim
Fandango_.

I found [this very old rant from 2001][1] which is cute in "Old
Internet" sort of way (I love how much more durable these sites are than almost
all fashionable web content; this is very much the ["Space Jam Website"][4] vibe),
but I also found it cathartic after feeling like a small-brain failing at _Grim
Fandango_ when I tried it a few years ago. I think I'm reasonably clever! I
think I'm pretty good at video games! And yet while I _loved_ Manny Calavera and
the dialogue and the setting, I remember breaking down and reading an FAQ and
being like "okay lol I **never** would have done that shit."

Adventure games, like my teenage explorations in anime or nerdcore, were
always something I wanted to like more than I ever did organically. I might be
alone in this, but I think a lot of hobbies come from wanting group membership
more than what the hobby entails. In a lot of cases, I knew I liked video games
and wanted to meet people in neighboring hobbies, but they never really stuck.
Ditto musical theatre.

If it's not about community, it can also be cachet: it's like those guys in
sweater vests who carry tomes of the Great Western Canon, and you're like _I
think you're really enjoying performing this character; I also don't think you
know how hard you're playing it._ That happens [all the time in programming
too][5], and I'm aware of doing it when [I talk about being grumpy and using
email-only on sr.ht and things like that.][6] Hard to find the line between
performing it and what you sincerely enjoy.

Adventure games! Yeah, I think I want the community or cachet. I'd like to be
the kind of creative and curious weirdo who thinks to themselves "right! If I
open the jar with a bee in the dining room, it'll enter the gears of the
grandfather clock and make the cuckoo bird come out, waking the guy from
sleeping! Of course!!" and seem to get a life experience out of it. But I don't
think I'm that guy!

This speedrun was fun to watch though, and did get me curious to play the Zork
series:

Also, [a great longread on Myst.][7] I did play it (with not one, but _two_
strategy guides!) and followed games media; it was a pretty interesting thing to
witness.

### Animal Crossing

I've been blogging on-and-off since 2005:

* 2005 was when I had a LiveJournal. I had a few "private" posts but changed the
  password to share it with a friend so she could see them. Now I have no idea
  what that password is, so absent web scraping, I'm not getting those posts in
  here üòõ

* 2007-2010 saw me FTPing files to a hosting service, running WordPress. My card
  expired and my host's warning email got spam collected, so they
  unceremoniously took down the whole thing. A few cringey posts are in the
  Internet Archive.

* I moved to Blogspot, but successfully exported those into here. And from
  2010-2017 there was a lot more "off" than "on" while I was going through the
  highly depressed tornado of my 20s.

So here's a link to a very early post in the "trying to get back into it" phase
in 2017, on [Animal Crossing: New Leaf][2]. I think the observations hold up,
and tonight, [New Horizons][3] launches. Unless they bungle it like _Pocket
Camp_, this is just what we need in a pandemic lockdown. Animal Crossing is
so damn soothing and wholesome, and such a delight to share with people. My
friend code is `SW-0499-8526-0009`, send me yours, and come visit!

Also, if you haven't caught the [crossovers with the _Doom_ community, give it a
look, they're delightful!][8]
