Folks who know me know that I'm

- harsh on capitalism, as is currently practiced in this second gilded age
- bummed about the tech industry; the criticisms for which are well-known and
  better-articulated by others.

One of the consequences of this is that it's hard to find a job I can
go into every day and feel good about. I left Lyft last May to
join a startup early; today we're widely launching. Time to talk about [Ramp][1]
üòÑ

## What it is

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
  <a href="/img/2020/2/in_the_wild.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/2/in_the_wild_THUMB.jpg" alt="Karen's wallet showing an EverBody business card and her Ramp card. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Karen's <a href="https://everbody.com/">Ever/Body</a> card "in the wild." They'll look nicer than this, these are early cards.</p>
</div>

Ramp is a corporate card designed to help your business grow. The primary value
prop is this: **we'll proactively help your company save money, extending your
runway, enabling you to operate more efficiently.** We'll of course provide
best-in-class Product features for any mindful CFO (accounting integrations,
receipt tracking, extremely easy issuing/revoking of cards for employees, limit
setting, notifications for significant events), making it more convenient than
many cards off-the-bat. But the big play is investing in tech to use your
transaction and statement data to help you be a smarter business.

Does your company use JIRA, Pivotal, Basecamp, _and_ Trello? Do you have an AWS
contract that's disproportionately expensive compared to other companies of your
size and market? Did someone book a hotel room that just went down in price, and
could easily be re-booked? There are **tons** of opportunities for savings in
any company, and we aim to build features to highlight and enable those savings.

This can be significant! While most cards offer cash back bonuses (as do we!),
**getting a dollar of cash back costs you a hundred dollars of spend to accrue;
having a dollar in your pocket from raw savings costs you nothing.** Given that
most startup failure is from running out of money, this can be significant.

Since a lot of programmers read this, I'll use my favorite metaphor: this is a
linter for your CFO. No matter who you are or how well you program, tools like
linters and formatters find and correct things that inevitably happen as your
codebase scales. We want to be the secret weapon of any CFO who's trying to keep
their company financially healthy.

## Markets, Efficiencies, Economics

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Our first
custom emoji was <code>:receipt-king:</code>, for the glorious <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/calvinleenyc/">Calvin Lee</a>,
who wrote some unbelievable receipt matching code, currently showcased working off
of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patelveeral/">Veeral Patel</a>'s head.</p>
</div>

When companies save money by closing leaks, _it's just more
efficient for everybody._ There are a large number of companies and CFOs who
fall through the cracks because they dropped one of the 15 balls they're
juggling. It'd be better for everyone if they could have a bit more slack.

While a lot of businesses are about rent-seeking or ingratiating themselves +
exploiting existing inefficiencies, I appreciate being on the side of our
customers.

## The people, the tech

</a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small"> We use
a couscous emoji in Slack to express
gratitude, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latyyfa/">one co-worker</a>
<em>saved my bacon</em> teaching me some AWS pipelines with Terraform, so I sent
this to Slack.</p> </div>

Joining a company as an early employee is usually a terrible idea as an
engineer: you take a similar level of risk as a founder with a fraction of the
upside. As [I said before,][3] Lyft was a pretty fantastic place to work (even
with my conflicted feelings of ridesharing lol). Leaving to join an early
company needed to be pretty special.

The founders of Ramp also founded [Paribus][2], a company where Karen was the
first full-time hire. She had a few very good years there, worked on excellent
projects and raved about the people and the culture they built. About 8 months
in, I can say confidently this was a great choice for me. My co-workers are
kind, receptive, brilliant people, I'm given agency over critical business
functions, I'm learning a ton about fintech and a few technologies I haven't
used before, deployed production Elixir, and am **eating up** a lot about early
company operations and growth. There's nothing quite like building something up
with fantastic people ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## Join us!

tech in the laptop stickers.</p>
</div>

[We're growing this year][5]. If this seems interesting to you, [email me][4]
and I'd love to chat. This isn't the best fit for everyone! And if you find
that it's not a great fit for what you're looking for, I'd be happy to talk
shop about hiring in NYC generally (I've‚Ä¶ been around üòõ).

Also, if you're in a position to make this kind of decision at your company,
consider using us! I think we built something pretty awesome, and it's only
going to get better.
