Late!

Last week, there was some great stuff out there.

### Male Gaze, Male Glance

_[The Male Glance][1]_, by Lili Loofbourow, articulates something I'd never had
a good name for: treating women and their work as less worthy of deliberate,
conscious consideration. Whereas the well-understood _male gaze_ is about
fixating only the specific qualities, _male glance_ is about choosing to stop looking
before you could determine value at all.

> The male glance is the opposite of the male gaze. Rather than linger lovingly
> on the parts it wants most to penetrate, it looks, assumes, and moves on. It
> is, above all else, quick. Under its influence, we rejoice in our distant
> diagnostic speed. The glance is social and ethical the way advice columns are
> social and ethical, a communal pulse declaring—briefly, definitively, and with
> minimal information—which narrative textures constitute turgid substance,
> which diastolic fluff.

I didn't read the byline (need to get in the habit! credit writers!) so I didn't
notice this was authored by someone [who's writing I liked so much two weeks
ago][2], on _Fifty Shades_. Nice surprise!

### ACAB

All Cops Are Bastards.

Obviously, not _all cops, in every absolutely way, literally literally._ But the
rot is prevalent and institutional enough you should operate as such. They lie,
imprison, kill, and abuse; they do so with impunity and receive no punishments.

Buzzfeed News, crediting Kendall Taggart and Mike Hayes, [spent hundreds of hours
reporting and verifying][3] a trove of leaked documents on abusive police members
who were allowed to stay on the force. Any settlements paid to victims of these
officers come out of our taxes.

If you want a starter kit on why cops need reform or abolition, here's a starter
pack:

* Killing unarmed people and lying about it in police reports. [Eric
  Garner][18], [Tamir Rice][19], [Walter Scott][17], and way too many others,
  and these were the ones where we were lucky to have footage of the incident
  disproving the lies.
* [Civil forfeiture][8], or [how cops steal more than burglars.][7] A
  [video][20], if you prefer that over text.
* Prosecution tactics that are one-sided, intended to get convictions and fill
  our prisons rather than seek justice. [Never talk to cops][9] without an
  attorney present.
* Leaving folks in prison [years without a trial.][11]
* [Planting evidence][12] [happens.][13]
* Cops [abuse their partners][15] at 2-5x the rate of general population.
* "But they risk their lives!" Their jobs, on the whole, are [less dangerous than
  fisherman and roofers.][16]
* More corruption, just from today: ["Alabama Sheriff used money meant for
  inmates to buy $740k beach home"][21]
* The NYPD [protecting officers][22] who've been accused of raping a 19 year-old in
  their custody.
* ICE [threw a detainee in solitary confinement for 60 hours][23] until she recanted
  an accusation of sexual assault.

Their union(s) and leadership doesn't speak out substantially against any of
this, and demand you worship them as heroes. While I recognize every population
has bad actors, normally there is recourse if they wreck lives. I don't have a
choice but to have my taxes support them, so I'll do everything else to point
out that they're an institution built on punching the weak.

### Banality of Evil

_The Washington Post_ published this softly brutal story by Robert Samuels ["His
American Dream died. His town got over it."][4], detailing how a model citizen
got deported and his community milked the attention, then looked the other way.

I think White people with Trump voters in their families should cut them off. No
more family holidays. No more time with the kids. Block on social networks. It
seems harsh, but there should be consequences for supporting enabling evil. If
there's no consequence for shitty choices, they'll keep making them.

These people voted for someone who made very clear that he intends to make life
hell for non-White people in this country, and he has. If it's hard to cut them
off, I'm sorry: I wish that was all I was worried about. I'm worried about
internment camps. I'm worried about black sites (hey, did you hear [about our
new CIA director?][5] Or the prisons by [the guy who got pardoned?][6]).

Trump people will cut me and my family out of your life and feel no lasting
remorse. It won't stop with Latinx people. Nobody can do everything, but we can
all do _something_. As long as they have voting power, make them think twice
before they use it to threaten livelihoods again. Do you ever wonder what you'd
do in a Civil Rights movement? Congrats, you're in one.
