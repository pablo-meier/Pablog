It's been a while since I've written about fun media I'm consuming, so here's a
more recent edition!

([previously][1], [previously][2])

### Enneagrams

Karen and her friend Sara introduced me to a personality-classifier called [The
Enneagram][8]. As Cambridge Analytica can tell us, personality quizzes are great
fun! As a kid I loved reading the [Chinese Zodiac][3] descriptions on the
placemat of our family's weekly night out, and Charly often incorporated
elements of astrology in our stories (Year of the Tiger and Virgo, baby).
Myers-Briggs is its own industry, even though it's [largely for funzies][4].

I approach the Enneagram with a similar of whimsy, though I give it a bit more
credit than most because its basis for personality types are fears and
motivations as forces behind the classification, rather than what year or month
you were born in. This makes it feel a bit more directly applicable: these are,
in my experience, great ways to model people and their decisionmaking.

Online treatments of the Enneagram are pretty lovely, but Karen and Sara always
seemed to know a lot more about the types and what their characteristics are, so
I picked up [The Enneagram in Love & Work][13], by Helen Palmer. The bits that
make the Enneagram good and fun are still present, but it can be a bit
repetitive; certain personality types feel like a slog to read through (which,
itself, is decent data for why I might find it hard to relate to some people
over others).

The way you know your "type" is literally "read through them and see which one
speaks to you." Most will in some circumstances but one or two will likely speak
to your general state rather than circumstantial ones. I think I'm a [One][10]
or a [Nine][9], but there's a lot I relate with on the [Five][11] and [Fours][12].
A great high-level blog post is [here][14].

Give it a try!

### Jessica Jones, Season 2

I'll keep this spoiler-free: I love a few compositional choices they made with
the plot, specifically with the antagonist, if you can call them that. You can't
really follow-up an enemy like Kilgrave with a traditional villain playing the
same game, and I really like what the writers did in its place. Marvel villains
tend to be [flat in the movies][7], and when they threaten to be interesting in
the Netflix shows (Stick in _Daredevil_, Cottonmouth in _Luke Cage_) they get
flattened out by something way sillier (The Hand? Diamondback?!). This felt
fresh!

I think it's criminal that Carrie-Anne Moss hasn't spent the two decades after
The Matrix as a major, major star: she stole every scene she was in. Malcolm and
his arc was exceptional as well, and Oscar was a welcome addition. Latinx people
in Netflix Marvel's New York were largely a strange prop in _Daredevil_, Oscar
is a step in the right direction.

It wasn't perfect: Trish's arc near the end gave me eye-rolls, and the pacing
was often uneven. On the whole, it wasn't as lasting to me as the first season,
but it's still better than both _Daredevils_ and I'd put it after Season 1 and
_Luke Cage_, in the Netflix spot.

It also had one of my favorite bits of dialogue in TV, when interrogating a side
character about someone named Inez Green:

> Inez Green? I call her Meanez Mean!

### More Celeste

I mentioned [Celeste][5] before, and I'm still playing through it. I've beaten
all the B-Sides and all but the last two C-Sides; while I'm still mostly
focusing on [my Deconstruct talk][6] when I sneak away I'm trying to get Golden
Strawberries. Wish me luck!
