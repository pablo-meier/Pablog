    og_description: Tumblr is banning porn; I think this is Bad, and part of a few Bad trends.

Tumblr is [killing porn on their platform.][16] There's a lot to unpack here.

It's usually attributed to one immediate and obvious reason, one less obvious
reason, and one backgroud reason:

**Immediate and obvious:** [Apple removed Tumblr from the App Store in late
November][2] citing reasons of finding child porn. Obviously there isn't any of
this _programmed in the app_, and any sufficiently popular platform with
user-generated content will display abhorrent or illegal content if you know
where to look (even if not overtly ‚Äî young families have photos of their
children [stolen from Instagram and re-posted for pedophiles][17]).

So the most common reason people say Tumblr is doing this is "well, they don't
want this to happen again," since it's disastrous to have your app pulled from
the store.

**Less talked about, but probably the bigger reason:** FOSTA and SESTA. They're
a big part of this story I'll elaborate on later, but the short answer
is that most content law for platforms doesn't penalize those platforms
_immediately_ for what's on it. If, say, a copyrighted video is on YouTube,
or if I upload my Facebook profile picture to Super Mario, it doesn't mean
YouTube or Facebook is _immediately_ liable to the owners of that content for
these infractions: they're allowed some time to get it taken down on the
copyright owner's request.

FOSTA and SESTA are different: if something looks like it might be used in
selling sex or sexual services, the platforms face massive fines without a
chance to "fix it." So Tumblr was probably looking at their porn content and
thinking "well, this is going to be a problem and we just got pulled
from the App Store, let's just do this now anyways."

**The final background reason:** Tumblr is a bit of a headless chicken, with
regards to principles. Tech companies tend to be [extremely deferential to
founders][3], even after an acquisition, and those founders tend to be highly
principled on what they want their platform to look like (the principles are
usually a White-centered libertarian-flavored mishmash of Free Speech concepts
I find reductive, but they are consistent, and applied!).

Tumblr's [founder is pretty long gone][18]; the platform languished a bit at
Yahoo! for years, and is now under‚Ä¶ [AOL and Verizon][19]. Leadership-wise, I
doubt the person running it has a whole lot of power per founder agreements, nor
willing to put it all down for their baby the way other companies often do.

### End of older internet ideals.

One thing to keep in mind is how this is, bit-by-bit, the fun and weird hobbyist
web many of us grew up with dying and being replaced by corporate-owned,
centralized web. [This article by Katie Notopolous][1] does a great job
summarizing this in the Tumblr case, but like [The Hays Code][4] did to movies
for a few decades, social pressures and capitalism have, for the past decade,
been making much of the old web's free expression die down.

I mention these links in a lot of blog posts, but they still apply here:

* [The Web We Lost][5] (tech platforms used to respect the user's data that made them notable)
* [OAuth of Fealty][6] (tech platform APIs are shit)
* [The End of ThinkUp][7] (and they've been getting neutered!)

Tumblr could have given 90 days notice. They could have provided an export tool.
They didn't do either of these things, just the axe.

Hey, did I mention we lost Net Neutrality this year? We'll soon buy internet
like we buy cable packages, which consumers **love**. We also [lost a browser
engine this week][20], meaning we have Apple on WebKit with ~5 percent of desktop
market share, Firefox on Gecko/Servo with ~9%, and soon, everyone else on Blink.

We lost Geocities, we lost Vine. And most of the emerging markets for tech with
billions of users literally [only connect through Facebook][21] or [are already
under totalitarian, heavily-monitored and censored tech][22] which [our tech
company leadership is eager to play along with.][23]

If you want to see what the future of tech looks like, I love [this look at radio
when it was a new technology and the various parallels with internet.][8]

### Progress isn't linear: people will suffer and die

Per the alt-text in [this xkcd][9], there's a fatigue when someone on the
Internet says "this will kill people." Fights for clicks mean that a lot of
issues get escalated as being of _critical importance_, and it can be depressing
to remember that there's so much suffering and trouble out there in this big
world. Try to deactivate that part of your brain if you can, and re-engage
empathy when I say **this, and FOSTA/SESTA more generally, is killing many
people in very vulnerable communities.**

Having platforms for empowered people to sell sex, acquire clients,
and vet them prevents sex workers from being under the thumb of pimps and
lessens the chance they find themselves in dangerous situations. When you
remove the ability to do this, you put more people in places where they're going
to get killed.

Here's a useful fact: on average, when Craigslist opened "erotic services" in a
city, the female homicide rate went down 17 percent. Not "murders against sex
workers," that's _the entire female homicide rate._ You can lower your murder
rate against women down 17% with this one weird trick!

(and that's just Craigslist: imagine if you had various platforms competing to
give them great features? Imagine if you didn't criminalize the sex workers?
Imagine if cops weren't frequently awful to sex workers?)

This shit [has been researched][11] and every sex worker with a platform has
used it to announce the danger of removing these platforms. I know Tumblr was
such a platform for tens to hundreds of thousands of such workers, and this 
makes their situations much more dangerous.

Some of the more accessible explainers on FOSTA/SESTA are [here on Vox][12], and
here's [a decent podcast episode][13].

### Capitalism

At the same time: if you're the corporate, rules-abiding type of person
who's now in charge of running Tumblr (or making other corporate decisions), in
light of all the above, what else do you do? Actually fight it? It's unlikely,
most companies with a lot to lose go right along with this kind of thing.
[Facebook is now tightening its policies of queer expression][14].

If a mayor of a town was confronted with a law that said any car or bicycle
accident will mean massive fines for the city, and the mayor and all their
friends have helicopters, what does the mayor do? Ban cars and bicycles!

I started this writing section expecting to be sympathetic to the
leadership at Tumblr, because I do, on some level, wonder "what else can they
do?" if you have a pornbot problem that's beyond your means to control.
But then I remember that I wasn't considering decisions outside of those
that validate the status quo.

Most of us [often say "there are no good solutions to these problems" when
there, in fact, are!][15] The Good Solutions, however, require us to kick out
old assumptions. So if I'm working with the framework that a solution has to be
low-cost, low-risk, and safe for Verizon, then yeah, there's not much
there.

But could Tumblr leadership collaborate with other tech boards to push against
FOSTA/SESTA? Could they raise awareness for what the laws are doing and who
they're killing? Can they start a foundation or initiative to build tools that
would root out and differentiate nonconsensual sex work from consensual sex work
on platforms like these? Could they collaborate with working sex workers on
solutions and share the findings? 

They could do any of these things! But they won't, like other
tech platforms won't, because it's _hard_ and they get paid either way.

(to be fair: I agree there's a non-zero amount of trafficking
happening on Tumblr (and Facebook, and WhatsApp, and Instagram I'd bet: they
have _billions_ of users, after all). And any amount is terrifying, and too much.
I just don't see evidence that these measures are reducing trafficking in any
meaningful way, whereas I _do_ see tons of compelling evidence that it's killing
people, disproportionately women, people of color, and queer populations).
