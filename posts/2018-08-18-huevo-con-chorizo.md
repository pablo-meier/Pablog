Lyft opened their NY office just last November, and we get lunches via
[Forkable][1]. An engineer named Matt Leventi visited from SF for a week, forgot
to turn off his lunch orders, and so for a bit of time we had an extra lunch
ordered in his name.

Another engineer took to reviewing the _Leventi Lunch_ in Slack. One time I ate
it, and left the following review:

> Today's Leventi Lunch is _Huevo con Chorizo_ sandwich, from [Miscelanea.][4]
> 
> If you have Latinx people in your life, they will probably gush to you about the
> wonders of chorizo. Chipotle launched and killed chorizo as one of their
> desperate ploys to get out of their post-salmonella tailspin, but their launch
> strategy reflected an organization in distress: their offering somehow took
> a material of God and made it an inferior, forgettable paste; reminiscent of
> the Taco Bell "meat" (which is [35% beef][3]) that their brand is virtually
> defined against. Eating Chipotle burritos is arguably the longest relationship
> in my life: I've eaten there for longer than all my romantic relationships
> combined. Loving other people comes and goes, but I can always get my burrito.
> Sadly, their ruining chorizo might be the thing that does us in.

> So it's with great delight that I can report that Matt Leventi's _Huevo con
> Chorizo_ is an excellently constructed lunch. The chorizo soaks in the bread,
> the huevo is perfectly cooked to allow two bite possibilities: the refreshing
> texture of the egg whites to counter the richness of the sausage, or a yolk
> bite, with its decadent, fatty creaminess. Each part of this meal is a happy
> surprise, with the lettuce adding a bit of color and variety from the
> otherwise-rich ingredients.

> There are serious environmental implications to eating animal products, and I
> often hope I'll one day become a better man and give them up. But if I'm in this
> transition period where I'm still eating indiscriminate, low-effort meals at the
> expense of our children's future, I'm happy it's for a sandwich like this _Huevo
> con Chorizo._

Not long after, Matt cancelled his order. Also, turns out Taco Bell's meat [is
88% beef][2].
