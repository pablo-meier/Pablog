<small><em>üéµ The song for this post is [Psycho Killer][10], by The Talking
Heads üéµ</em></small>

I'm chewing a lot on friendship + communities, and wanted to write a bit about
them. I don't think I'll have time to write _that_ post up tonight, so instead
I'll write about something adjacent: the good collective noun for such a group
of friends/companions.

So "finding your tribe" is a often used for what I'm after, but as a non-Native,
this feels like [using "Spirit Animal" and the problems associated with that.][1]

In the case of "spirit animal", one White person who wanted to be culturally
aware [suggested "Patronus" as a substitute][4] (explanation [here][2] if you
didn't read Harry Potter).<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> This
might map to "Hogwart's House?" But that's far too large and inclusive. "My Ron &
Hermione" is a bit too specific to that cast, and really, we all know [that story
was about Wayne.][7] Besides, Twitter leftists will criticize you for comparing
too many things to Harry Potter (no, [for real][3]. To be truly _cool_ you
have to fail to understand that popular media being popular means that it will
be recognized and used in many places).<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>

I like "fellas," largely because of this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Judas:
still on for Friday?<br>Jesus: Friday?<br>Judas: yeah, the last supper<br>Jesus:
the what?<br>Judas: supper. Normal supper with the fellas</p>&mdash; David
Hughes (@david8hughes) <a
href="https://twitter.com/david8hughes/status/551900828093517824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January
5, 2015</a></blockquote>

But "investing in the fellas" and "finding my fellas" doesn't quite have the
same ring to it.

There's also "the boys," from tweets like this

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">its
fucked up how there are like 1000 christmas songs but only 1 song aboutr the
boys being back in town</p>&mdash; wint (@dril) <a
href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/670963270317154304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November
29, 2015</a></blockquote>

and [others in the meme][5] (like [here][6]), but it suffers from many of the
same issues as "fellas," as well as both being gendered.

Next up is "chums," which invokes the memory of Wesley Snipes:

I call my tabletop groups (a D&D group and a [Mouse Guard][8] group) "the lads."

For the last few years at work I've been calling my team "Comrades!" which is
inversely appreciated/loved with the size of a company I've used it at. It's
probably the one I like most, especially as I'm more open about leftist policies.
I'll probably use that in most instances. When I wrote the post I'll have this
more figured out.

üê∏ Sapo üê∏ appears to be recovering nicely. His incision looks pretty gross but
he's more-or-less back to his energetic self. He goes in to the vet tomorrow for
a follow-up, and in 13 days to get the sutures removed.

We had some friends over for a game of [RoboRally][12]. I got last place.

Thinking of your Patronus is a fun exercise. Mine would be a [zergling][9], or
if I had to keep it with real animals, maybe [a cuttlefish][11].

Most of these same folks never respond negatively to Simpsons screencaps
used in the same way. I enjoy it plenty and hope they keep up with it, I just
wish they had more awareness of how much of their games and criticisms mostly
exist to make them feel superior (as is true for many groups).
