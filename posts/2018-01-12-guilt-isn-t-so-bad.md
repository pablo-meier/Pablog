A favorite novel I read in High School was written by a German and had, as one
of its central themes, how German national identity spent many decades after
WWII wracked with guilt for the atrocities they committed. Many "ordinary men
and women" were or supported Nazis, served in the military, and participated in
a regime that killed millions. After the war, most of them went on living: while
some were prosecuted in Nuremberg, most were citizens who worked to rebuild.

So there's an country that's got a whole lot of national guilt. And this author
(rather effectively, I'll add) brought the reader to sympathize with the
pain of this guilt.

But you know what's worse than guilt? **Getting murdered by Nazis.**

The Jewish, the queer, the disabled, the leftists: they didn't have to _live
with guilt._ They **got fucking murdered,** or beaten, or experimented on.

When I look at [the White, old coalition of people][] who brought President
Trump's rise to power, I struggle with how I can peaceably share space with
people who think half my family is subhuman. Who sees no problem with elected
officials who want to electrocute my queer friends until they say they're
straight.

The best I can come up with is "maybe they'll see someday." And then, I guess,
feel guilty? This is hardly a comfort. The lives getting destroyed by this
administration (the Dreamers, the 200,000 Salvadorians, the children under CHIP)
can't live on a tiny bit of White Guilt, years later.
