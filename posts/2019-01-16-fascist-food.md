    og_description: Fascists are the worst, and they can't even be interesting about what they eat.

Because we live in The Hell Timeline, we were treated to this:

[Helen Rosner][6] wrote [a great thing][5] about the spectacle:

> Trump, in typical form, spun Monday‚Äôs catering as ultimately the fault of his
> political opponents, an inevitable result of his own elective [government shutdown][8],
> which has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees
> furloughed‚Äîincluding, presumably, the White House kitchen staff. Trump, a
> purported billionaire, made a big deal out of the fact that he paid for the
> fast food out of his own pocket. But we might wonder if there is also something
> more pure in his decision to bring in a drive-through feast for the history
> books: an attempt, however opportunistic, for a man who loves fast food to
> fulfill his straightforward desires‚Äîa gilded hall filled with as many fried and
> griddled patties as money can buy, more Filet-o-Fishes and Quarter Pounders
> than one body could possibly consume, the teetering towers a quantifiable
> testament to his Presidential power.

But before this, she wrote [another piece on the President's eating][7] that I
like more, and find relevant to the idea that he probably just ordered this
because it's what _he_ thinks it's cool:

> It‚Äôs possible that President Trump has very good reasons for preferring his
> steak well done. Maybe he makes a yearly practice of trying a medium-rare
> ribeye, just to make sure that his preferred doneness is truly a matter of
> subjective preference, and not some damning psychological tell. But his other
> eating habits, even in the context of his reported germophobia, speak to a
> gastronomic risk aversion ‚Äî a fundamental lack of trust ‚Äî across the board. He
> prefers fast food, and rarely varies his order. His favorite dish at Mar-a-Lago
> is the meat loaf, and that‚Äôs not even some inspired chef‚Äôs creation, it‚Äôs the
> meat loaf of his childhood, his [mother‚Äôs own recipe.][11] He has
> [a well-documented aversion to eating with his hands.][12] When he dines at Jean-Georges, the
> three-Michelin-star restaurant in the Trump International Tower in New York, he
> asks for a personalized order ‚Äî ‚Äùthe special thing you made for me,‚Äù Chris
> Christie [recalled][13] him requesting of a server ‚Äî rather than the innovative,
> creatively constructed dishes on the menu. Donald Trump is not a man who likes
> to try new things, and that says a lot about him.

They're both better when read to completion! They're not long! üòÑ


(also, he _definitely_ didn't pay for the fast food like he claimed. this is the
man who [took money from a charitable foundation to pay a $7 Boy Scout
registration fee.][9] he [cashed a check for 13 cents.][10] he's the cheapest
bastard you know)

In general, I don't like meme-ing fascism; I was pretty irritated by
"covfefe" jokes, and MAGA hat parodies feels like the humor equivalent of
slapping Googley Eyes onto a swastika. Ridiculing and humiliating fascists using
humor is great! But toothless, cutesy displays that trivialize the shit we're in
just reminds me that this is just a game or a distraction for a lot of
well-intentioned people.

But for this event, in the spirit of ["Woman Takes Short Half-Hour Break From Being
Feminist To Enjoy TV Show"][1], I enjoyed a lot of the clowning folks have done
on this one:

Also, _The Atlantic_ did a ["50 Unthinkable Moments of the Trump Presidency"][4].
And [On The Media][3] did a great segment with Daniel Dale on [just how much this
fucker lies][2]. I'll never forgive the 62 million dipshits who voted for him.
