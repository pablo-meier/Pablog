### Money is fake

A cool thing college-educated liberal arts majors say is "race is a social
construction," which is a fancy way of saying "it's a made-up thing by society."
Definitions and boundaries about race and races change all the time with
geopolitics and zeitgeist; if humans were wiped off the face of the Earth and
aliens dug up our bones, they wouldn't look at one skeleton or another and have
any conception of "races" in the way we talk about them. Which isn't to say it's
not "real!" Obviously race and racism have very material impacts on our lives,
even if it's just a set of fuzzy ideas that we fumble around in, it becomes
a major driving force that can take the whole potential of a human and [put it in
prison for stealing socks][1], letting someone else to profit on their caging
largely because enough powerful people collectively believe in it.

Another big social construction is money. Obviously, money is real: I can hold
it, and it drives virtually all power in most societies. But like other social
constructions, it's made up. Just like race is ostensibly based on not-made-up
things like groupings of certain genetic markers that are found together more
frequently than other groupings (usually melanin) but in practice is just humans
making shit up at each other, in theory, money is a convenient way to account
for the fact that goods and services that people want are more scarce than the
amount of wanting.  Everyone on Earth might want a Tesla but only so many Teslas
exist and they're not easy to make and making them requires other scarce things
and the labor of many who wouldn't otherwise build them, so we use money as a
way determine who's willing to sacrifice the most to have one, how to get people
to build them, and the supply and demand reach an equilibrium.

_You can't just print out money and give it away for no reason!_ say the
economists, _because the underlying reality doesn't work like that._ If you give
everyone $1000 for no reason, in theory nothing important changes because
everyone has the same raise in "buying power," so we'll all bid up the prices to
the same stuff about the same amount. That's often what happens with
hyperinflation, like [Germany after WWI][2] (Ã¼berinflation!).

So reading [this Money Stuff][3] and the section on Money Market Funds (of all
things) needing bailouts, after the last time, is fucking frustrating. You look
at the sheer amount of money we'll pump to bail any and every industry (cruise
lines?!) or, in this case, financial instruments "afloat" but business-as-usual
is people dying of insulin shortages, or the Sacklers getting people addicted to
opiodsâ€¦ it's just heartbreaking.

I loved the Econ classes I took and think working free markets not only work
pretty well at resource allocation, but _you don't really have a choice but to
deal with them_ because they're emergent phenomena anytime you put people
together who have things and want things. But even being a Markets Liker doesn't
mean that you like all things that get described by charlatans as "free markets;"
the shit we're doing here is flat-out barbarism, and I wish so badly that there
were repercussions for crapping so hard in society's oatmeal.

### Latinos, music videos

Let's watch some music videos together. One, _how_ is Daddy Yankee still kicking
it? He's ageless; the Paul Rudd of pop music. Look at this shit:

To say nothing of his appearance in _Despacito_:

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kJQP7kiw5Fk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The first video (Muevelo) has a similar "music is outlawed by martial rule" as
this old favorite by BIGBANG, which was big when I was seeing a lot of K-Pop
because StarCraft. I still watch it from time to time because I like the tune
and costumes:

Here's _Gasolina_ for context, which is from George W. Bush's first term:

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CCF1_jI8Prk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Wild.

Part of it might be how much sunglasses seem to be tied to Latinx masculine
expression. Back when we could go outside, I walked by this billboard all the
time.

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/vacilon_THUMB.jpg" alt="Radio show ad where 2 of 3 men have sunglasses on." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

And, like, see this video (**ALSO WITH DADDY YANKEE**)

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0VR3dfZf9Yg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Literally all of them have sunglasses.

One of the advantages of sunglasses is how much aging happens in the areas
around people's eyes. Eyes are also a high-risk zone for attractiveness to drop
off. Like, sorry Mr. President, but something gets lost when we see the eyes
underneath:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/pitbull_glasses_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/pitbull_no_glasses_THUMB.jpg" alt="FILLME. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

#### Cooking break

Cooked a little veggie egg scramble yesterday:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/eggs_1_THUMB.jpg" alt="Lots of chopped veggies + ingredients." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/eggs_2_THUMB.jpg" alt="Cooking on the skillet" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/eggs_3_THUMB.jpg" alt="As a scramble with hot sauce." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

And while we're quarantined, we're still Millenials:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/avocado_toast_THUMB.jpg" alt="Avocado toast with walnut, onion, tomato, and feta." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

#### Additionally! (extreme nerd sidebar)

I really wanted to link to the specific subsection of _Money Stuff_ above, but
couldn't, barring some xpath horror show. It is my firm belief that all CMSes
should add an `id` tag to generated `<h1â€¦5>` elements. It's such a huge
convenience when you want to link to a subsection of an article.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

I often say "text is the one thing that the web has always been good at"
(mostly when I yell at someone who found a way to fuck it up, like Medium), but
that's not to say it's solved! A related bugaboo is custom markup formats: I
vaguely know (and don't know!) how to format things in JIRA, Linear, and Slack.
While [Markdown knowledge isn't common][8], man, you'd make _my_ life a fuckton
easier if you all:

- Used some pretty faithful adherence of Markdown. It doesn't have to be
  CommonMark, but please don't let it deviate too much.

- Offered a "plain-text" editing mode. Nothing better than having a "smart"
  editing field do the wrong thing, then you gotta work around it's smart logic
  to make it do the right thing. A plain-text view with a preview pane
  ([lobste.rs][7], or GitHub) lets you see your work while also not kneecapping
  you during authoring.

At the same time, I'm still the guy pining for when I "typeset" documents in
LaTeX, so feel free to ignore me.

I realize my blog doesn't do this ([Omd][4] did, but now that my blog uses
[Commonmark][5] via [cmark][6], titles get rendered nakedly)
