    og_description: I played 3 video games this past month. Games are fun!

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxXl39Ichh4">Bamboo Boogaloo II</a>, by Rainbowdragoneyes, for the game The Messenger.</em> üéµ</small>

I frequently tell Karen: "On Earth-2, Pablo plays a _ton_ of video games." While
Twitter followers see [screenshots][13] [of][14] [Celeste achievements][15] and
I've [written about a years-long dedication to StarCraft][2], those two games
account for 90% of what I've played in the last 8 years.

But growing up? Until I was about 15, I played video games _all the time._ I
played Squaresoft RPGs for 10-12 hour stretches (beat [Emerald Weapon][3] but
never beat [Ruby][4]), I beat _Battletoads_ hover-bikes, and got blisters on my
palm from _Mario Party._ There's a world where I never pulled back from this.

The reasons I pulled back are part of another post; but in December and January
I played a few new ones and ended up loving them.

(I played all these on my PC with a Dual Shock 2 controller, but most of my
friends would probably have an easier time finding these games on the PS4 or
Switch, since almost nobody I know has a gaming PC, and those that do don't use
gamepads üòõ)

### Timespinner

_Timespinner_ is a big, sloppy kiss to _Castlevania: Symphony of the
Night_, so of course I love it. There's no single game for which I can say
"favorite of all time," but when people ask I say SOTN.

SOTN has everything: over-the-top theatrics (listen to [the voice
acting][6], or just [look at the game's art][7]), one of the most beautiful 2D
single-player console games, puzzles and curiosities in places where it doesn't
make sense (e.g. Shield Rod mechanics, sitting in chairs, the sequence in the
confessional booth), a gorgeous soundtrack, and _an entire hidden second game_:
being released before the Internet was so ingrained in our gaming habits, it was
entirely possible to play it and miss the second castle. Leigh Alexander [wrote
a tribute][8] that articulates much of its romance. Also, watch someone [play it
blindfolded!][9]

So it's hard to play Timespinner and not think of _SOTN_: the title placards when
you enter a new level, the gameplay mechanics (backdashes, RPG leveling,
familiars, spells), even the music can be similar (listen to the motifs [in this
from SOTN][17] and [this from Timespinner][16]). **And it feels great.**
When I was learning programming in college, I wanted to make a game like
this, I'm so glad someone else made it so much better than I could have.

The story is a lot richer than SOTN's, dealing with issues of colonialism,
causality, vengeance, and progress. The cast is also very 2018, with much better
representation than AAA commercial games (the only identifiably straight man in
this universe is the power-hungry imperialist who kills your mother. The jerk
from your village is probably also a straight man but they don't delve into his
identity much, and even _he_ gets Deep Relatable Reasons why he's a jerk). There's
a "coming out" scene that I found pretty adorable, and most of the powerful
figures are women.

(to be absolutely clear: I appreciated all of ‚òùÔ∏è)

I cut through it all in about 7 or 8 hours; something I've always said about
jazz solos is that it's much better to be left wanting more than thinking they
went on a little too long. This game was delightful fun, and I was left wanting.
I just started Nightmare mode, it's pretty damn hard üòÖ

Another noteworthy thing about this game: finishing projects! It's hard! I feel
like they really polished the edges of this, but [the Kickstarter for this ended
in 2014][10] and it was just released in 2018. Meanwhile, [Ritual of the Night][1]
continues to not specify a release date, which was "2018" for a while. Games are
hard to make well; when you're playing one, try to appreciate that labor.

### The Messenger

_The Messenger_ is a game I couldn't put down, nor can I always say I was strictly
having fun the whole time I played it. Its aesthetics are absolutely delightful:
many indie games have twee self-aware writing, and this is among my favorite.
The homages in its soundtrack and graphics to earlier generations of games are
also pretty stellar. I can't say I played much _Shinobi_ or _Ninja Gaiden_ or
_Strider_ (the closest thing was _Mega Man Zero 2_ for the GBA) but this makes
me wish I had.

Unlike _Timespinner_, its cast and story are a lot more contained. Not to say
they're weak, but the game is always very well aware it's a goofy pixelated game
awash in tropes and motifs. The shopkeeper, Quarble, and bosses are treasures.
All told, I spent about 12-13 hours on this, because I'm a sucker and [wanted to
collect all the Power Seals.][19] I don't know if it was worth it.

There were two elements of storytelling that I absolutely _loved_; if you
played, guess which ones in the comments!

I cursed a lot when playing this game üòÖ. Here's [a recent speedrun][12], if
you're interested.

### Hollow Knight

I'm about 9 hours into this, and it promises to be the biggest game of the
three: watching the [AGDQ speedrun][11], they say it takes most people 40 hours
to play casually. I'm beside myself that it was mostly built by two people: the
production values and sheer amount of _game_ in there are huge.

The Knight and their needle are fun to pilot, especially when you unlock more
movement mechanics. The bug world of Hallownest is beautifully rendered. The
bosses are fun, inspiring, and pretty frightening. It's Goldilocks-hard.

Between all the other games I've played recently (the previous two, Celeste,
and about 20 minutes of [Battle Princess Madelyn][18]), it's frankly
pretty refreshing to play a 2D game _without_ pixel art. The hottest take I
have (which even I don't believe most of the time) is that 3D games were a
Mistake and we should only make 2D games. _Hollow Knight_ is just gorgeous.

I'll have more to say about it later; for right now it's the biggest reason I'm
falling behind on some of my non-work goals üòé
