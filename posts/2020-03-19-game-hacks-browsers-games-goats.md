    og_description: Today's rambles are on hacking in old games, free software, Slack fun, and board games.

### Ye Olde Compute storeys

Baked some really disappointing biscuits today (I never though I'd have to type
those words); ate them over a 20-minute break watching this, which I enjoyed
more than I thought I would:

I'm generally a big fan of the "weird computer things we did to make games
great" genre: the "War Stories" video series above features Andy Gavin and Naughty
Dog's story of Crash Bandicoot, [the blog posts for which were legendary][1]
(_they wrote the game in muthafuckin' SCHEME!!!_). Gamasutra has [so][2]
[many][3] [good][4] [articles][5] about [this][6], and Patrick Wyatt wrote some
good [dev blogs on the road to StarCraft][7]. I suspect a lot of the
nostalgia around these stories, beyond the actual tech content, was around a
time when you could viably make commercial games played by "the masses", with
small teams, on more-understandable stacks.

I wonder: will we be making videos like this (or writing articles) for modern
games and consoles? Which ones? There's some fun out there, like [Terry Cavanaugh
open-sourcing vvvvvv][8] or [_Celeste_ open sourcing the code for Madeline][9].
We'll have retrospectives, but I'm finding it harder to believe it'll have the
same impact, since the constraints are less severe, the hardware/software
systems involved are so much more complex, and the games landscape is much more
massive.

Reactions while watching the video:

**Man, "Shadow Man"? And you meet him jumping into a mirror? lmao.** After so
much _Celeste_ I should fire up an emulator and give it a go.

**Re: rotoscoping/VHS/animation:** art gets better with constraints! This is
part of what makes pixel art so much fun. I've got to play (or develop) some
PICO-8 games. Also, [Sheep it up!][10]

**Should I fire up an Apple II emulator?** Would be fun to play some old, old
games.

There is so much value in keeping journals. I should keep a paper one too; I've
kept a few but its been years.

Reminded again what a privilege to be working with computers at this point in
history. Industry's got problems but computers are marvelous.

### `:mag:` + `:shipit:`

</div>

Years ago I wrote up some [cultural things I do in companies][11] that a lot of
co-workers seem to appreciate, try this one in your Slack when you want help
sleuthing things.

### Board games for two

Haven't capitalized on it, but [Vox wrote an article of best board games for 2
players][20], for if you're quarantined with anyone else. I think the only one
of these I've played is _Fog of Love,_ and we were unimpressed by it. Karen and
I actually _don't_ have a surplus of time on our hands; we're both still
hustling at our jobs on most weekdays, and when one of us gets a break, the
other is usually on a call or doing late night company coding. So it's more
Pandemic bot for me; if you're interested in playing a game with one or both of
us, or a virtual movie night, or somesuch, reach out!

### Web browsers

Drew Devault [wrote a bit about the terrifying complexity of browsers.][12] On
the aggregators, commenters focused on the methodology of his quantification,
but I feel like that's missing the point. Like, sure, it's flawed and an
approximation, but it's a cute number that tells a story I don't think anyone
disputes: nobody will build a new web browser that renders the modern Internet
anytime soon, because we've grown the requirements up to something unattainable.
You can view this as a problem or not.

I do, but I'm also resigned to it. I'm doing the little I can as an individual
(using and boosting indie web and tech) to fight against most of the forces that
consolidate the web for private companies, of which the exploding complexity of
browsers is one. After spending the last year or so doing it (and getting
increasingly comfortable with it), I'm pretty sure a core contingent of us will
stubbornly keep it alive for ourselves, and I'm cool with that. There are
serious elitism issues with ["Eternal September"][19] (and, like, I wasn't on
USENET lol), but for those who care about these things üëÜ we'll find our place.

### GoatCounter üêê

</div>

I moved the site's analytics to [GoatCounter!][13] No more Google Analytics!
Trying to detangle my properties from the big monopolies, support clean
Internet, and products obviously written for and by humans. This one is written
by [Martin Tournij][14], and its obviously a product towards an Internet I like.
While [Amado][15] isn't a project I'm actively building or plugging, when I feel
comfortable paying for any of its components (bootstrapper's delight: Amado
costs ~$3.50 a month!), I'll definitely move it off Google and get it a proper
GoatCounter business license.

Also, I love goats. I _might_ have [carefully read the WikiHow on starting a
goat farm][16]. And [other][17] [articles][18]. It's not a today plan, or this
year plan, but maybe before I'm 40. Goats are like Sapo, but larger, and better
at speaking. Long live goats.
