Ian Bogost and Alexis Madrigal wrote a pretty solid [in-depth look at Trump's
Facebook game][1], often mentioned but poorly understood. If you hear stories
like "Trump ran 100,000 Facebook ads in April" and not really known what that
meant, this demystifies. It's also, of course, terrifying: much like COVID was a
story of something we could have contained if we acted fast enough and now the
cat is well out of the bag, Society May Never Be The Same, and institutions we
relied on will never recover, Facebook's control over the Internet and minds of
the populace is past the point of easy repair. I don't know how anybody thinks
populations are "above" propaganda with even a cursory understanding of history.
And hey, [Facebook's nonconsensual research on its users demonstrates it
too.][2]It's also the entire business model: "we influence users [their
purchasing decisions via ads]"

I wrote about [why I left][3] (about a year and a half ago!, wow, time!), and
sometimes when scrolling over Karen's shoulder, I miss it. I missed a birthday
party invite. I wonder how people are doing. One of my last memories on it was
discovering a cute girl I had a big crush on in Middle School (we saw
[_Swimfan_][5] lol) died in a car accident two years earlier.

But apart from that odd pang (maybe once a month? every two months?), I really
don't miss it at all. I don't miss the mindless opening of a tab
several times a day to feel like garbage in the quest to distract myself from
why I'm not living a life I would enjoy more. I've got plenty of other vices. 

One of the prevailing themes of the article was how advanced AI systems are
inscrutable for their users, builders, and operators. It's pretty funny
that we've put so much power into what amounts to a giant, opaque game of Plinko.

Whenever folks pretend to be experts in extremely complex systems, I always
think of those terrible "shake the table" football toys. I hear them sincerely
believe they're _deep, strategic thinkers_ about something so arbitrary and
uncontrollable. Most of these fields are such that you can't verify or falsify
anyone's expertise because there are too many variables at play: politics ("the
reason [X] won is because of [theory that validates my worldviews]"), business
("seeâ€¦ they should have built something better! if only they'd knownâ€¦"), or how
you can be sure your world-devouring AI-powered product isn't causing worse
problems than it's solving.

Anyway, chaotic system go brrrrr

### Ben rules

The absolute legend Ben Hutchison [responded to my documentation post][8] with a
fantastic comment on [his work and motivations in documentation][7]. Do check it
out! And comment, engage! It's more fun that way lol.

Ben also coined [Ben's law:][6] "if a game has horses, the game has horse
physics problems." I snapped an example from _Fire Emblem_ last week:

### Cool video

Ian Danskin is behind [Innuendo Studios][4], which does a lot of cultural
analysis, especially around legions of angry extremely online men. He did one on
agency in _Blade Runner 2049_ which I enjoyed, even though I haven't seen it:
