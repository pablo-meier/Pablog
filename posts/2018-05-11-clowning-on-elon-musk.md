    og_description: If you admire Elon Musk I think you're wrong, or at least focus on the wrong things.

On one hand, I'd love for this blog to contribute to positive discourse; to
inspire joy rather than anger; be part of the solution instead of part of the
problem. Statements that were benign and agreed-upon ("Nazis are bad people,"
"police shooting unarmed people is wrong," "the President should be transparent
about their finances and shouldn't profit from the policies they enact") are
recently, weirdly, _divisive_, and I believe this is in part due to algorithms and
products that [are explicitly designed to extract dollars from our attention.][9]
It doesn't have to be this way.

But.

We also can't _fix_ any of the above without identifying its causes and
symptoms. If our attention and compassion are being strip-mined for profit,
who's calling those shots? Who decides that money is worth the downgrade of
society? While many systematic problems can't be blamed on mere individuals,
you also can't assign them to _nobody_ or their choices.

So I might occasionally write a character portrait of certain prominent figures
whose roles in the above, I feel, need to be better-understood.<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
It's not the powerless or the poor who create and uphold systems which keep
the powerless and poor in place.

I spend a lot of energy being grumpy and goddammit, if you're reading this,
you're invited to see why. Today let me tell you a bunch of things about Elon
Musk.

### Why he's celebrated

It's easy to see why: Elon is the public face behind a number of companies
that look like they're paving the way for the science-fiction future we dream of.
"Where's my flying car?!" for his admirers is answered by the
companies he's creating: [SpaceX][10] (rockets and space travel), [Tesla][11]
(named after the [folk geek hero][4], cars of the future!) and [The Boring
Company][12] (kill traffic with high-speed pneumatic tunnels!).

His personal brand is one of effervescent nerd-humor: he wanted to sell a
flamethrower, wasn't allowed to, so he sells it as ["not a flamethrower."][5]
SpaceX [launched a convertible][6] into space with a figure named after David
Bowie's _Starman_.

Most of the last century has been filled with fantasies about what wonders
technology could bring us. Technology has largely delivered: from radio to
televisions to computers to the Internet, it's unlikely there's been a century
of _this_ much upheaval in our history. The last few generations of advanced
societies have been conditioned, correctly, to look for people to bring on that
next world-changer, and it looks, at a casual glance, like Musk is an engaged
visionary who could bring it about.

For a lot of people, he's [Hank Rearden][34], and his products are their own
versions of Rearden Steel: through sheer genius and force of will, he's building
better cars than the car people, better rockets than the rocket people.

### Alright, but

But, well, he largely sucks, and his companies are very expensive branding
exercises that fail, as projects and/or businesses. Folks making him out like
some kind of Henry Rearden are just [suckers for simple stories and have
incomplete models of reality][35] (and/or don't have a whole lot of empathy for people).

We'll start with Tesla. [They burn an extraordinary
amount of money.][13] Taking VC dollars and using it capriciously to gain market
dominance is pretty expected, but we're talking about a level that scares VCs.
They post abysmal numbers and [his shareholder call trying to assuage them went
rather off the rails,][14] where he pretends that _investors caring about the
financial performance of their investment_ is somehow "boring" and "stupid."

He's in the midsts of [gender discrimination][16] and [racial
discrimination][15] lawsuits, the merits of which [he is clearly is not taking
very seriously.][17] His company has been investigated several times for poor
working conditions and found to be negligent and dangerous for workers (three
separate times! [May 2017][18], [Feb 2018][19], [April 2018][20]). He [brushes
that off too.][21] Weirdly, [the company retaliates against those who
want to start a union!][22]

</div>

[The Boring Company will flat-out never work.][7] He's trying to create a system
which will do public transit's job better than public transit, [but he hates
public transit and demonstrates no evidence of interest or knowledge][23] on its
successes or failures in over a century of history.

SpaceX (and other companies) [take massive government subsidies while still
being privately owned][36]. He's privatized the gains but socialized the
investment. He's loved by libertarians and Objectivists but [behaves exactly
like the antagonist of Atlas Shrugged did][37].

If you've ever heard the term "Starter Wife" it was [coined by Elon's ex,
Justine Musk,][24] based on her experiences being married to him. Check it out
if you want to read about a dude who wasn't a great husband with winners like
"if you were my employee, I'd fire you."

### Why does this matter

Because, stupid as it sounds, we can only address our social problems when we
address our social problems. A foppish billionaire using several hundred
millions of VC dollars (and billions of public dollars) to ostensibly build toys
for the rich in the success case (let's be real, he's not putting poor people in
his rockets to Mars) saps away efforts to meaningfully address social problems
that affect people.

Even if you want research that leads to better cars or rockets (I hate that we
barely fund NASA, personally), can you invest in a person who doesn't brush off
workplace accidents? Someone who's companies don't become hotbeds of
discrimination? Can the people footing the bill be included in its profits?

The workers cited in the Tesla workplace accidents? The employees behind the
racial and sexual harassment claims? These are _real people_ who are negatively
impacted by choices Elon makes, and it's a disservice to give him a wide pass
because [he jokes about bacon on Twitter.][25]

There are some smooth-brains who will support a charismatic character no matter
what facts you throw at them (apparently Elizabeth Holmes still has acolytes).
The rest of us, though: don't fall for his grift. Demand more.

I was at Google when Larry Page was CEO, and the culture there told us to target
"moonshots:" highly improbable projects that can change the world. Oddly, the
following are never considered moonshots to tech luminaries like Larry and Elon:

* Poverty
* Hunger
* Racism
* Sexism

I think they should be considered‚Ä¶ they seem ambitious enough ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But nah, they want toys like [balloons to increase their customer bases and
self-driving cars][8]. Larry even said, paraphrasing, that when he dies [he'd
rather give away all his money to Elon Musk instead of charity.][26]

So yeah, stop lionizing this shit. Or, continue to! But don't get huffy if I
consequently think you're either ignorant of what I'm linking to here (no longer
an excuse!) or a simpleton lacking in empathy.

[A good comic,][38] as a chaser.

A favorite example of this exercise is Alex Pareene's [The Hack List][1]. There
are a number of Serious Figures in national discourse who suck and make things
worse for everybody. His dressing down of [Jonah Goldberg][2] is a favorite, and
in a similar vein, [this takedown][3] of Ben Shapiro by Nathan J. Robinson is a
cathartic read.
