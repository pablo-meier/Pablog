    Title: Dip your toes into some MUSIC (part 1: Chip, Dub, #Deep, Mashup)

One of the most fun parts of dating someone can be learning about the art that
moves them and sharing the art that moves you. I've read books for people,
eaten albums, played video games, binged TV shows, and generally been exposed to
all sorts of amazing this way.

[The Lady][40] and I are, 11 months in, still finding new things to throw each
other's way, but one place we differ is what resonates with us. A frequent
phrase I use is that I hear the world more than I see it, and she tends to see
it more than she hears it. As an example, the other day we were in a long line
and I knew it was at least 4 minutes because an entire song and a half had played.

After a bunch of conversations, it occurred to me _wow, I've got a lot in this
catalog._ I thought I'd compile + share some categories and artists; maybe you
find something you like? I tend to throw them all into one playlist; a friend
referred to it as "whiplash-inducing."

_All of this is just me, sincerely describing things as I'm consuming them. My
terminology/categorization can be exceptionally noob._ But this is my space,
dammit; there are no comments on this blog, Imma just be me.

That said, **I am better than [Pitchfork][1],** which [famously only gave Music
a 6.8][2].

### Chip Music

##### Background

</div>

Remembering Chiptunes is what motivated this blog post; yesterday Karen and I
were debugging a group's WordPress install and it seemed like a fitting pick for
the mood we were in.

Broadly speaking, Chip Music is making original music that largely integrates
sound generated under the constraints of old consoles. The hip way to do this is
with literal hardware, using something like [Little Sound DJ][3] on a Game Boy,
but you can hack it by using software and sticking to the specifications of the
hardware ([Game Boy][4], [NES][5]).

I first got into this when some game publication (_Electronic Gaming Monthly_?)
did a feature on [8bitpeoples][46] when I was in high school. After that I
downloaded a ton of their tracks, and found it in other places.

##### Selections

Some favorites of mine:

* [The 8 bits of Christmas][6] album. This has Bit Shifter's [Let It Snow][7]
  which was used in [an Adobe promo video][8] after I'd worked there for a few
  months ðŸ˜›

* I was also a fan of [_Information Chase_][9], by Bit Shifter. A choice track
  is [Reformat The Planet][10].

* [Chipzel][11] is goddamned amazing. I first heard her work in
  [Super Hexagon][12], also worthy of your time. [Otis][13] is probably my
  favorite of the soundtrack but you really can't go wrong with any of her work.

* Likely one of the most popular acts in the scene is [Anamanaguchi][14].
  They don't stick to strict chip music; they tend to layer it over
  guitars/drum/bass. Favorite of mine is probably [Meow][15].

* **Last individual artist** I'll namedrop is David Sugar, who as far as I know
  only really made [one chiptune album for 8bitpeoples years ago.][16] That
  said, I _loved_ it, especially [_Bang!_][17].

* Of course, _actual_ game music from the period is amazing too. Mega Man 4 was
  the one I grew up with so it's naturally my favorite, in particular, the
  [Pharoah Man][41] stage. [Toejam & Earl][42], on the atypically-used Genesis,
  is also Up There. And WOW for such a forgettable game [Silver Surfer][43]
  _squeezes_ the hell out of what that chip is capable of. [Castlevania 2:
  Simon's Quest][44] (famous for it's `WHAT A TERRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE`
  line) is fun.

* For new stuff, I tend to find artists by following the [CHIPTUNES = WIN][19]
  compilations.

There's a ton in common with this and other "video-game nostalgia" subcultures,
like Pixel Art. A lot of the same questions of authenticity and who follows
what constraints are present, see [this great article][18] using pixel art as an
example and note how it also applies to the music I've linked.

### Dubstep

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align:center;">
<video src="/img/2017/06/dubstep.mp4" autoplay loop><p>Key and Peele gif

<p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic">From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kod1q39ddE">this tutorial explaining dubstep</a>, if you haven't seen it before.</p></div>

I am _hardly_ the person you want to consult about dubstep: it's a hammer I
reach for pretty infrequently. I jokingly refer to "Mad Wubz" when I hear it.
That said, it was Dubstep that inspired this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">new
jargon: to &quot;sandstorm&quot; a song is to love it ironically, listen to it
repeatedly, then realize you loved it sincerely the whole time.</p>&mdash;

2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was doing ritual watching of [over-edited Dota 2 highlight videos][20], and
learned that I was _actually_ getting pumped when I hear the intro to Skillex
Reptile, like [in this one][21].

So I have Skillex on some playlists and gave up trying to be #ironic and #cool
about the whole thing. My first exposure to Skrillex was hearing
[Kill Everybody][25] on [IdrA][26]'s stream when [he played vs. MVP on Shakuras
Plateau][45] and miraculously won. Others of his that I like are [Scary Monsters
And Nice Sprites][27], [Bangarang][28], and [Reptile][29]. I also got into him
more because we used so much of his music in the dance fitness program I was in
training to teach, [Pon de FLO][32]. Of those we used [Killa][30] and [Make It
Bun Dem][31].

I also love self-reference, so I had [this track by Dubba Jonny][22] on
playlists for years. The moment at 1:53ish is one of my favorites.

Dubstep is also responsible for the worst B section of a pop song of all time.
Hyuna's [Bubble Pop][23] is a decent K-Pop song from the era and was a mainstay
with [HuK][24]'s StarCraft fanbase. But _goddamn_ is that a terrible, horrible,
no-good, very bad B-section.  

### `#DeepTrance` and `#DeepHouse`

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align:center;">
<video src="/img/2017/06/rave_dogs.mp4" autoplay loop><p>Dogs raving</p></video>
</div>

Thisâ€¦ is a tough one for me. A more typical name for this is probably just
modern rave music. Guess what, I started going to raves in the last year! But
I find the music not to my liking. In my various years of knowing people
submitting work to writing groups and not getting mad enthusiasm I always used
the metaphor of playing Coltrane to a bunch of dubstep fans: they're listening
to what might be brilliant work but calling it insufficient because it lacks THE
DROP or HEAVY WUBZ, when that's obviously not what the author was going for.

I feel like this music doesn't fit what I usually go for. [I ranted about
it on Twitter.][33] But I'm trying; I find it lovely to code to since it's
continuous and totally inoffensive, and by merely being exposed to it so much
I'm finding elements I'm enjoying.

[Here's a lineup][34] of a festival I was just at, for which I did some
pre-listening. [Joe Foxton][35] and [Renegade Masters][36] are pretty good
examples of this. [Caravan Gitane][37] has thrown a party or two with a great
lineup.

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align:center;">
<a href="olga_klimova.jpg"><img src="/img/2017/06/olga_klimova.jpg" alt="Art of Olga Klimova" style="display: inline;" /></a>
</div>

I'll mention two anecdotes that might help frame how I'm approaching this: while
at IFEEL, we ran into [the art of Olga Klimova][38]. I'd just dropped some acid
but hadn't felt like I'd come up yet, until I noticed the art was _breathing._
For a while I wondered if it was an effect of the artist: there were blacklights
shining on it, and wondered if it was painted in layers, or there had been
layers of canvas with fans behind it. No, stupid, it was the acid; but it was
_enthralling._ 

It hit me that these paintings were made with people tripping in mind, so
maybe the music was too. My core criticism against most of what I heard at
these parties was "there's no sense of progression." Most music I love bumps,
bounces, sways, stabs, falls, slips, and feints; most of this shit just lightly
thumps forever. But those paintings weren't an animation, they were paintings.
With acid, they had movement, and the experience was almost spiritual. Maybe
you're supposed to just fill in the blanks with your trip.

(On the other hand, I've also long felt that "if you need drugs to enjoy the
music; maybe your music could be better).

The other anecdote supports the above and comes from another party. Karen and I
went there hearing it had a great lineup, and felt a bit let down that all the
music sounded similar to everything else we'd heard. We gave up on some of the
other party spaces, found a chill space, and ended up losing ourselves in
heart-to-heart conversations. Four hours had passed before I knew it.

I came out feeling like "maybe _this_ is what the music facilitates." That
connection + ambiance to have conversations like we'd had that night, and the
kind that lead people to [divorce their parakeets][61] after Burning Man.

(The raves/parties are a new thing. I have a lot of reactions, but that's for
another time or post. A great read related to this is [the fine advice of Rave
Grandpa][39]).

### Mashup

##### Background

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; text-align:center;">
<img style="max-width: 300px" src="/img/2017/06/neil_cicierega_mouth_sounds.jpg" alt="MOUTH SOUNDS" style="display: inline;" />
<img style="max-width: 300px" src="/img/2017/06/electrolemon.jpg" alt="Electrolemon photo" style="display: inline;" />
</div>

I feel like mashup as a concept is one of the most exciting things about being
alive when we are. The 20th century gave us recording medium as a whole but the
digital revolution really democratized what's possible with it. Mashup
precursors required a ton of labor and a fair bit of capital to have a decent
media library and what's needed to alter it (thinking of splitting tape, per
[_Come Out_][47]'s court testimony, Public Enemy's [sample-based work][48], or
the super-fun lesser-known [Emergency Broadcast Network][49] using VHS tapes).
Computers enable a huge number of people to create pretty remarkable stuff.

About mashup, I used to say (arguably cynically?): what if you only took
the best parts of most songs and put them together? Like the "only marshmallows"
bowl of Lucky Charms? Take the melodies/hooks of songs and leave nothing else ðŸ˜›

##### Selections

Back in the day I really enjoyed [Super Mash Bros.][50], with a [few great
albums.][51] Hard to find official-looking web presence, the closest being [this
SoundCloud][52]. 

Neil Cicierega, known for a ton of great Internet treats like [BRODYQUEST][53],
its criminally underappreciated [Mashup Megamix][54], and [Potter Puppet
Pals][62], has released a few entire mashup albums: [Mouth Sounds][55],
[Mouth Silence][56] (a prequel), and [Mouth Moods][57] (a "zequel"). His work is
silly and satisfying.

One of my favorite people of online is [Demi Adejuyigbe][58], who has made a ton
of [mashups][59]. My favorites are when he made "Yakety Sax" into a wedding
march

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p
lang="en" dir="ltr">i am available for all weddings <a
href="https://t.co/TofabCCcE5">pic.twitter.com/TofabCCcE5</a></p>&mdash; demi
adejuyigbe (@electrolemon) <a
href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon/status/735585856551948288">May 25,
2016</a></blockquote>

and then added DMX:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p
lang="en" dir="ltr">let dmx walk you down the aisle <a
href="https://t.co/StcMV3XmpZ">pic.twitter.com/StcMV3XmpZ</a></p>&mdash; demi
adejuyigbe (@electrolemon) <a
href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon/status/735597859752398848">May 25,
2016</a></blockquote>

Not my favorite example of artful mashup, but [Vinyl Fantasy VII][59] and [The
Ocarina of Rhyme][60] hit nice nostalgia buttons.

There are a ton more, but this is long enough. Stay tuned for more parts.
