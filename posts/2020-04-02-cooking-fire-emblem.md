Posted some cooking [a few days ago][6], here's some more. I find cooking during
the quarantine to be a good release: it's a process that's not my job, feels
"productive" but away from the computer, uses my hands, and often smells/tastes
good as a reward. There's just enough creativity involved ("what's rotting next?
what do we have a lot of?") while not feeling super high-stakes.

One of the bigger losses I'm feeling is the lack of baked goods. It's indulgent,
but one of my previous habits was going to a coffee shop and getting a coffee
and scone (or croissant or muffin or what-have-you). In terms of unit economics,
it's expensive, but in a penny-wise/pound-foolish way, it's not a major 
expense for me. Something something self-care.

So, locked up, Karen and I don't bake much, and didn't include ingredients for
it in our grocery-buying. But lo! I found an old bag of flour that I didn't know
we had. We had exactly four eggs left. And a can of pumpkin! So I made
pumpkin "muffins," wrapped in foil since I didn't have parchment paper:

</div>

They came out pretty well, all things considered. Hard to go wrong with sugar,
flour, spices, and pumpkin. Not much to look at, but I've had 6 of them üòã

Meanwhile, we had a lot of backed-up rice from old takeout orders (back when
that was a thing) that we were _never_ going to eat. I'm not eating
meat, but Karen still does, and she had some pork that was going bad soon, so I
whipped up some pork-fried rice:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

  <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">When you don't own a spatula or have ingredients for a proper garnish, "plating" is just the same for all of these things: drizzle that Sriracha.</p>

As [I said about national politics recently][5], there is no _going back to
normal_ here. With record unemployment claims and a looming Depression, I never
use the phrase "when things go back to normal." But! When some things re-emerge
(getting to leave the house more freely‚Ä¶ God, am I having a hard time without
the gym) I hope I can keep the energy + focus to keep cooking. It's been such a
net good all-around.

### Blogging

Karen doesn't proactively read this blog, but sometimes I'll tell her I've
written posts, and she gives them a look. I told her about the last week or so.

### Fire Emblem, Vidya Games

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2020/4/fire_emblem.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/2020/4/fire_emblem_THUMB.jpg" alt="Hubert from Fire Emblem, having tea with Byleth. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto;" /></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">I describe Pablo's Law at the bottom, but there's also Pablo's Tenth Law: if you have a tea minigame, I <em>won't</em> like it. See: Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box.</p>
</div>

I'm playing [Fire Emblem: Three Houses][4], since I got a Switch recently,
mostly for _Animal Crossing_ with Karen and That Horrible Cooking Game with
Saurya. It's‚Ä¶ a really funny game. It's my first Fire Emblem, and there's a lot
that I love about it.

I often joke that _Hollow Knight_ is really three games in one: you've got one
of the better Metroidvania epics of the last decade, but with the White Palace
and Path of Pain, you get a few hours of _Celeste_-like, and with the boss
rushes of the _Godhome_ expansion you've got something like _Cuphead._

I only mention this because _Fire Emblem_ is also, like, 3 games in one. You've
got the turn-based tactical battle game, sure, but it's also a dating
sim and _SimCity_ or _Project Hospital_ for running a school. I'd love to say
more about what I think about its combat vs. _Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the
Lions_ or _XCOM_, but in the 7 hours I've played in the last two weeks, I think
I've fought, like, 4 battles? There is _so much_ exposition, menus, and tweaking
in this game. 

One of the games inside _Fire Emblem_: a tea-drinking minigame that is literally
the Simpsons joke of a _My Dinner With Andre_ arcade game:

<video style="max-width: 95%" autoplay controls="false" loop>

</video>


When consoles got 3D games, _Super Mario 64_ really left a dent in the culture
about what platforming could look like (part of why it's so damn studied, and
the king of speedrunning popularity for most of either's history). That said,
Rare somehow took "open world, collect Stars!" and made it:

- open world, collect golden bananas, colored bananas, medals, blueprints,
  fairies, crowns, keys, coins! ([Donkey Kong 64][2])
- open world, collect jigsaw pieces, treble clefs, note nests, feather nests,
  jinjos, globos, cheato pages, honeycombs (3 kinds), and game paks!
  ([Banjo-Tooie][3])

so when they finally released _Star Fox Adventures_ and tell you what
a [Bafomdad][1] is part of me just broke and wondered "good lord, why am I wasting
my life collecting imaginary objects?"

Anyways, playing Fire Emblem, I feel like we've gotten very, very close to peak
Something, just like Rare made Peak Collectable in the N64 era. The wax on the
wings isn't melting yet, but it feels close, and I might feel differently if,
after 40 hours, I'm only 15% through the game and had 4 more fights.

Two last things:

* Like when I first played _Skyrim_, I'm flabbergasted by how much damn content
  there is.

* Pablo's Law still applies: if there is a fishing minigame, I fucking love it.
