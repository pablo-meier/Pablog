    og_description: A single note can get you very far. Siblings. Accidental lesson on what ears like. Muffins.

<small>üéµ <em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSzCp10Mowg">Hay Que Trabajar</a>, by Oscar de Leon and Tito Puente.</em> üéµ</small>

I have a _deep, technical post_ in the works about differences between
SQLAlchemy and Ecto (they're both great for very different reasons even
though I'm a "raw SQL" kinda guy) but it requires _research_ and _effort_
so y'all are getting domestic ramble posts, maybe forever.

I've gone from "never log in to Twitter, write-only" a month ago to logging in
once or twice a day and still seeing some some fantastic shit on it. Today [it
was this:][4]

This reminded me of this tune, which is a joke between my brother and I (the
title translates to "that little sound"):

My brother shared it with me on Facebook in‚Ä¶ 2009? 2010? He shared it with a
caption that was something like:

> There's just something so funny about a bunch of moderately looking guys
> hitting a single note on a cheap keyboard over and over again

And while he's right, he accidentally struck gold with the phrase
"bunch of moderately-looking guys," which I've found infinitely useful in the
decade since.

This song is a great example of inter-sibling humor (in our large extended
family, it's cousins too, who are mostly of comparable age); I don't know how
popular this song is broadly, or how general the amusement for it is, but Robert
and I share it, and I love that we do. Karen (adopted and an only child) once
asked me how it was to grow up with siblings and I responded with "I've really
enjoyed it. I came into the world and there was someone there with an example to
follow, and who knew all the rules. It was like having a fellow inmate who
fast-tracked you on the rules of the prison," then made a mental note for my next
therapy session to investigate why my brain reached for _that_ metaphor.

While looking for that YouTube clip, I got reminded of a funny moment in an
audio engineering class I took in college, called "Using the Recording Studio as
a Compositional Tool" (great time to remind everyone that I have a Music degree
but can't play instruments lol). It covered the basics of audio hardware,
software, and did a tour of mixing techniques; my final project was a scene from
a radio play.

That class was an absolute blast (shout-out to Jim Moses, legendary professor)
and it changed how I hear the world. We'd learned about how to use effects to
make things sound better, and to test us he said "I'm going to play you the same
clip twice, and want you to tell me which you like better, and guess what I did."

I'll do the same thing here for you, using [Francisca Valenzuela's
_Flotando_][1]. Listen to the first:

<audio controls src="/audio/2020/4/flotando_1.mp3">
Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code>element</audio>

now the second, and guess what adjustments I made:

<audio controls src="/audio/2020/4/flotando_2.mp3">
Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code>element</audio>

All but two of us liked the second one more. A few of the guesses:

- Equalizer boosts of the mid-range: our ears hear (and value) the range where
  speech falls much more carefully.
- Hi-pass filters and/or low-pass filters: similar idea, this can help remove
  "cruft" from the sound since again, extreme highs and extreme lows tend to be
  where extraneous sounds and accidental overtones enter.
- A lot of us guessed a light compressor to make the amplitude peaks softer;
  this was a good guess for the wrong reason, and I suspect we landed on it
  because we'd just learned about it (and learned that "most songs are
  compressed to death on the radio").
- Other guesses: a "de-esser," or maybe a change to reverb in the echoes/room we
  heard, but that was likely because we were desperate.

Nobody got it entirely right. No, the answer isn't "they're actually the same"
lol. Scroll down for the answer.

"The second example is 2db louder."

That's it. Most people just like things that sound louder. It's a devlishly
simple hack, just like "add more salt and butter" can make your food taste
closer to restaurant quality.

The reason a compressor is a good guess is because it usually brings
additional gain: while a compressor _lowers_ volume at the peaks, most
compressors have a gain slider that gets bumped up to make up for the
lowered peaks, increasing the average volume. Your ear is better at detecting
average volumes than peaks anyways. Watch [the first few minutes of this][5]
to see how this happens, and why it's the sound of "radio voice."

The fact that people like things so much louder is also why there's no dynamic
range in pop music: it's just **LOUDNESS, ALL THE TIME**. If you change to your
local classical music station, it always sounds so much quieter than the music
on the other stations because their music has to respect <em>pianissimo</em>s
and <em>forte</em>s, so they play at something that is, on average, softer than
the music on most other stations.

Those first 30 seconds of _Flotando_? They have this waveform:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/4/thirty_seconds_waveform_THUMB.png" alt="Actually looks like a wave with various peaks." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

but the whole song has this waveform:

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/4/entire_song_waveform_THUMB.png" alt="A few waves but mostly A SOLID BAR OF SOUND." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

I thought of this because while I linked [this Sonidito video][2], it was
auto-followed by [this Sonidito video][3] and I was like "wow, this is so much
better."

I made blueberry cupcakes last week, they were awesome.
