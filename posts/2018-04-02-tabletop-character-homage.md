If you've never played a tabletop RPG like [Dungeons and Dragons,][4]
[Mouse Guard,][5] [Dungeon World,][6] or [Fate,][7] I _highly_ recommend you try.
It makes a game out of storytelling with friends and has an extremely high ceiling
compared to most other entertainment.

Last year, some friends invited me to a Dungeons & Dragons game they were
running. It's the first time I've played in many years, and I feel like sharing
the backstory of the character I'm playing. Since I came in late, the players
met my character in a burial mound near a town called Sul's Horn:

### Backstory

Like many monks, he was left at a monastery as a baby, with no clue to his past
or origin. Even the most charitable monasteries would swiftly reject a
[tiefling][3] baby, but this monastery was one following the teachings of
[Ilmater.][1] Maybe accepting him was a political move by an ambitious master,
hoping to improve their standing? Maybe leadership wanted a challenge, even
though this "project" had a reasonable chance of failure? The tiefling never
felt fully welcome there, and many had their misgivings; nonetheless, he was
taken in and made useful. He was taught humility, charity, and how to defend
himself. He was given the name "Homage."

While he showed promise, his mind often wandered. Nobody could see when his
focus wavered, as his solid green eyes didn't have pupils to follow. They
never noticed how often his eyes were looking at the dark corners rooms. He
could swear he saw flickering in the shadows.

After a few weeks of odd shadows and hearing whispers, he was getting suspicious
of supernatural influence, and ready to say something to the masters. On his way to
a master's hut a hand pulled him behind a tree. He immediately found himself
surrounded in blackness. Magic? He'd heard it existed, but never seen it. The
hand belonged to a gnome standing before him, who introduced herself as Elhani.

She spoke directly, stating that his true name was Karreus. She claimed to know
more of his origins and ancestry, but said "your past matters less than your
future. You are chosen by [Mask.][2] We watch you, as you will learn to watch
others. You can choose for your life to be that of your masters here, but you know
you will never feel whole. When you are ready to pursue service to a real
power, activate the scroll."

He was back at the monastery to find a scroll in his hands. He was technically
home, but felt more like a stranger than ever. He questioned whether to trust
the gnome, but this was the first time he felt like maybe he mattered.
After mulling it over it for three days, from the safety of his dormitory,
he activated the scroll.

After a **boom!**, he found the whole dormitory collapsed, killing or wounding
dozens of other students. The masters peeked out of their buildings and found
their tiefling experiment Homage, completely unharmed in the center of the blast
radius, over the screams of pain coming from the rubble. They ran towards him,
and he instinctively ran away. He heard a voice (Elhani?) calling to him from a
shadow: he ran into it, and emerged several thousand feet away. He knew he could
never go back, the experiment in compassion failed.

Emerging from the shadow, he had a paper in his hands. It said "Seek Ryton in
Sul's Horn. The clues to your past are where you'll never lose them." He then
noticed the other (hopefully final?) side effect of the scroll: his torso and
arms were covered in tattoos. Runes? Scripts? He could swear he just saw one
move! "I'm going to have to cover that up soonâ€¦" he said.

When he got to Sul's Horn, the only word he heard about Ryton was that he was
long dead, and vague speakings of a burial mound. He walked in, hoping to find
a tombâ€¦

### Other Notes

Under his Ideals, I gave him a quote: "If there's no reason to be seen, don't.
If you must, make it useful to you. You have no home but your body." He's a
[Monk][8], but he very easily could have ended up on the [Rogue][9]'s path. His treatment
as a tiefling makes him reluctant to be interacted with, but the same treatment
(and his desperation to get along at monastery) made him extremely charming
when need be.

Ilmater is not a particularly combative deity, so his training included lots of
acrobatics, jumps, landings, and literally "hanging around," often by his tail,
to the chagrin of his masters. He's broken a few bones in his life trying what
we would today call "sick-ass parkour" but the injuries haven't discouraged
him.

He's frequently conflicted about his allegiance to Ilmater's teachings and
those of Mask, who he barely knows but emotionally resonated with. It's hard to
undo 22 years in a monastery that glorified compassion and suffering. Despite
being a pretty poor student, much of Ilmater's teachings dripped into him via
osmosis.

Personality Traits:

- Extremely charming! Skilled at socializing, but ultimately anxious.
- Playful: if you leave a room and say "don't touch," wellâ€¦

Flaws:

- Conflicting approaches from Ilmater teachings + Mask tendencies. Often one
  will betray the other.
- Resentment at never belonging can fuel some Bad Decisions.

### Playing Homage

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Both
aesthetically and how he contributes to encounters, Homage shares a lot with
Nightcrawler, my favorite X-Men.</p>
</div>


Homage exemplifies most characters I've played in D&D over the years. He's reckless:
to paraphrase something said of the [Dota player Jimmy Ho][10], "[Homage] is the king
of those high-risk, low-reward plays." We had one game where we had to rid a
town of a [Basilisk][11]; Homage's suggestion was to play dead and smell delicious to
lure it out for the rest of the party attack from afar. Overall, since he's not
real, I let him take a lot more risks than I would.  

In terms of mechanics, he's very Pablo in that he prefers charm, charisma,
deceit, mobility, and indirection over things like martial prowess, or magical
utility. My characters never clear out a room with a very powerful spell, or
wield the best weapons or armor. They're mostly _slippery._

He's also a very Pablo character in that he makes smartass comments, and can't
resist a good joke. When coupled with his mobility, it makes me joke that I
accidentally created Spider-Man, taunting enemies with one-liners while zipping
around them.

I love playing him, and might write up other characters I'm playing to show
where I hope to deviate.

### On D&D itself

If you've never played tabletop RPGs, it's probably the least accessible of the
games I listed in the intro. Each player ideally buys and reads most of a
Player's Handbook (not cheap); the DM has to buy the other two rulebooks and
prepare adventures. Unless you have some decent experience, it's
not very pick-up-and-play.

That said, if you've got friends who play or have played, it's an extremely rich
game. Reading the spell list and imagining scenarios to use them is more fun
than a lot of fiction, and there's worlds upons worlds of supplemental material.
It's iconic for a reason.
