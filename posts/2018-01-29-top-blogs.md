_ðŸŽµ The song for this post is [Papa Was A Rolling Stone][21], by The Temptations.
ðŸŽµ_

One of the best of our field, [Julia Evans][2], published [a gist of her
favorite tech blogs][1]. I'll take the same opportunity to list a bunch of my
favorites, with some history for why I think this practice is valuable. If you'd
rather just see my list, scroll down!

<h3 id="the-humble-blogroll">The humble blogroll</h3>

I miss [blogrolls][5]. A blogroll was a list of links (usually blogs) that
the author of the site you were viewing curated to let their readers know of
other sites they appreciated.

You still see them every now and then,<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>
but on the whole they've disappeared, like personal sites themselves. Blogrolls
are a close cousin of [the webring][9], and both were ways site owners
collaborated to serve both their readers (by showing them where the good stuff
lived) and other site owners, by giving them more viewership. Both were a lot
more important before web search got sophisticated, and people came to the web
_en masse_.

<h3 id="feeds">Feeds</h3>

Coming a bit later, and very popular, were _RSS feeds._

Let me be clear: when I say "popular," I mean popular with regular
Internet users of the time, which was a much smaller, odder group than who's on
the Internet today. Smartphones hadn't been invented, laptops were
cumbersome and expensive, Wireless Internet was a luxury you couldn't count
on finding, computers and connections were slower, and we were a lot less good
at making _polished web experiences_, we made shitty _pages_ like this one.
These were the kind of people who _sat_, deliberately, at giant boxy computers
and humming monitors, to [listen to a computer scream for 40 seconds][10] before
they got a shot at reading what other weirdos left out for them.

One of their favorite technologies had blogs broadcast their content so you could
collect all your blogs in one place: the site would expose their content in a
machine-readable way (mine is [here][11]) and anyone can tell their "readers" to
pull down the articles to be read all in one place, at the user's convenience.

It's a bit like your Facebook or Instagram timeline, but without ads! And
without an external agent hiding things from you, even though you expressed
interest in seeing them ðŸ˜›

<h3 id="arms-races-building-the-web-for-the-machines">Arms races, building the web for the machines</h3>

The big revolution Google brought to web search was [to use hyperlinks to signal
importance.][8] It wasn't enough to say the word "dogs" 200 times on your
website to get to the top of search results, if 5,000 other websites linked to
yours with the word "dogs," your website is _probably_ a reputable one about
dogs.

This is the start of how the web got consumed by machines to serve us ads.
[Anil Dash][7] wrote [a fabulous article][3] describing how we stopped making
companies _on top of_ the web for the benefit of users, and instead _made the
web_ for the benefit of companies (and by extension, capital), at our expense:

> But by attaching monetary value to search ranking, what Google ended up
> catalyzing was a never-ending arms race, where they constantly updated their
> algorithm and each community on the web constantly tried to learn how to
> exploit the new mechanics. The stakes of the algorithmic arms race kept going
> up; [...] understanding how to appease Google became the cornerstone of
> multi-million-dollar marketing campaigns. [...] it became about publishing
> content that suited the algorithm, whether it was true or not. At first, the
> only people paying attention were nerds making content management systems,
> then a broader audience of people trying to optimize their search engine
> positioning.

> Eventually, though, movements across the political spectrum came to understand
> that knowledge of how to appease the algorithms that govern social media had
> profound social and cultural power. It wasnâ€™t just marketers who figured out the
> best way to promote their ideas, it was trolls and activists and harassers and
> people on the fringes who wouldnâ€™t have had any way to get the word out
> beforeâ€”both for better and for worse. At that point, the rise of
> [fake media markets][18] was inevitable.

So the blogroll was an animal that became extinct by being extremely nutritious
to its predator. By being a signal of what matters on the web in PageRank, it
was instrumental in "mapping the web" for search, like road signs in a small
town. Once we had maps, we destroyed the road signs. And now the map makers
are extorting us.

<h3 id="killing-the-golden-goose">Killing the golden goose</h3>

Facebook does the same to our social relationships. We get some nice things for
sure, but have little control over what we get to see, we must see it with ads,
while they learn every detail about us and do every cheap trick they can think
of to be scrolling their News Feed endlessly.

To see how silly the asymmetry is of the value prop, give these a look:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9ZqXlHl65g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oVfHeWTKjag" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Facebook charges people _to show you the things you asked to see._ They
[experiment on you and your moods][19]. They deny their algorithms have any say
in election results but assure advertisers they can influence your spending
decisions.

It's no wonder we're all polarized, angry, and miserable. And it's [hitting
our youth in staggering numbers.][13]

<h3 id="so-blogs">So, blogs!</h3>

I've mentioned before [I'd like to participate in making the web more open][4].
I highly encourage us to visit the sites we like, and maintain our own web
presences when able and possible. And I hope we can have rich experiences
without having to trade our lives and identities to ad platforms.

I encourage us to use RSS Readers and other decentralized, democratizing
technologies, or at the very least, to build on them. I'm using [Feedly][14],
though I'm looking again at [The Old Reader][15], and may look into hosting my
own (I'd be willing to share!). My clients are [the venerable Press app][16]<sup id="place2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>
and [Newsbeauter][17], though Feedly has an app on all platforms that works
pretty well. You can download this list as [a list of urls as a text file][22] or
[as an OPML file][23], which these tools can use to import.

So! If you're looking for great things to read, here are many of mine!
