I backed Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night on KickStarter [when it was announced
years ago][3]. It was released last week! And I binged it, because [I love me some
Metroidvanias][2]. Here are a collection of reactions.

### They delivered what they promised, and it's charming!

They did it! üçæ They escaped the "famous gamedev crowdfunds" trap:

</div>

_Ritual of the Night_, I can say, is a game! That hits many of the arcs as
promised! And I did (pretty happily) get through it in about 12-13 hours, and
feel like you could do a lot worse! All that said‚Ä¶

### Wow, the bugs

While I wouldn't call them "gamebreaking," getting several instances of very
obvious bugs in a casual playthrough while not deliberately trying to break the
game is‚Ä¶ a bit embarassing.

* Continued audio: twice, a continuous sound effect would never turn off. The
  first instance of this was meeting Alfred, where he was chalking the floor: I
  left the room to find a save point, and the chalking sound followed me
  everywhere until I triggered the cutscene. The worst was the final boss: Bael
  has this lightning attack that was playing when I killed him, but never turned
  off, so the entire ending cutscene had this electrical buzz louder than the
  dialogue. I'm hearing how The World Is Saved while sounding like The World Is
  A Faraday Cage.

* Item drops and their sprites: a ton of times enemies would "drop" items you
  couldn't pick up, or invisible ones that you did.

* Two-headed knockoff: while playing [this boss battle][1], I got knocked _off the
  stage_. I ran out of bounds (which blackened the screen), ran back inbounds, and
  tried to rejoin the boss fight. I ended up behind him, and just started
  cracking my whip until I found the hitbox, and hit him to death from the back.

### Ham, nostalgia, fan service, and pleasing

On Twitter I compared this to _Arrested Development Season 4_: fans went
**nuts** with hype since _Arrested Development_ was a comedy like no other in
2003, the notion of it coming back was a dream come true. But since 2003 we've
had _30 Rock_ and _Bojack Horseman_ and other clever, cutting comedies with
recurring jokes. _Arrested Development_ broke the mould, but it came back with a
disjoint cast a decade after the mould has been broken, and arguably improved
upon.

Similarly, SOTN is a breathtaking work, but it's 22 years old, and its torches
have been carried by others in the time since. I can't reasonably expect anyone
to make a game that will resonate with me like that did when I was 10 years old.

</div>

But they raised $5m on exactly that sentiment. So what you see are a lot of
attempts at _being_ SOTN, almost too directly: you can sit in the chairs, just
like SOTN! There's a librarian who's actually Alucard lol. The final boss is a
lie, like Richter! Even finding the _real_ final boss is _identical_ to SOTN:
you have to acquire special armor to get past a spike corridor to get another
special item you need in his fight. Like, it's appreciated! But friends, you
could have done literally anything differently!

### The deliciousness of Derivative work

I feel like this also works in its favor. Great art comes from constraints,
and the fact that this has to be Castlevania without being allowed to be
"Castlevania" means you get some funny workarounds. _Bloodstained_ isn't allowed
to be Dracula's castle, and the demons can't be Dracula's army. But they are‚Ä¶
_something._ You have Boers, a lion with a circle of legs. You have this
[metal-playing lady who magics you with her hard guitar][4]. A [giant cat
wizard][5]. [Demonic barbers][6].<sup id="place1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

<p>It feels a bit (in character, not production value) like <a
href="https://twitter.com/Bootleg_Stuff">the bootleg stuff Twitter
account</a>.</p>

### 3D, checking the boxes

The last critique I'd offer is that 3D (and building on Unity) probably helped
them make this multiplatform: you can play this on consoles, your PC, and the
Switch. But for all they tried to do fan service with this game, I feel they
could have done better by the fans with with tigher controls and/or more work on
the animations. 

I'm going to steal some assets from [this most fantastic article][7], which
compares when Street Fighter III (in 2D) got succeeded by the first 3D Street
Fighter, _Street Fighter IV_. Miriam looks and moves like Chun-Li in _Street
Fighter IV_:

whereas I feel like the alternative games I'll mention downthread at least
_feel_ more fluid and smooth-to-control as I feel when I see the 2D Chun-Li:

</video>

Especially in boss battles, Miriam felt like navigating a tank, and I didn't
love the way the game looked or moved.

(Independently, [you should absolutely read the article I cribbed these from][7],
it's a delightful look at art, consumption, nostalgia, constraints, and humans.
It came to mind a lot while playing this).

### So you want a successor to SOTN?

Then give this a try! It's evident that I had lots to chew on, and 
it's chock-full of content I could go on to unlock if I was so motivated.

That said‚Ä¶ I feel like some of the games in my last post are a bit better for
the Metroidvania itch.

I feel like **[Hollow Knight][10]** hits the romanticized "epic Metroidvania" a lot
better. It's a proper epic, taking 40 or so hours to get through. Its controls
(both platforming and combat) are smooth and silky: I joke that it's really
three games in one, since White Palace feels like _Celeste_ and the boss rush of
Godhome feels like _Cuphead._ Its aesthetics are hyper-polished.

If you want a SOTN tribute project, _[Timespinner][11]_ is worth a look. It's
about as long as _Bloodstained_, has beautiful 2D art, and controls a lot closer
to the GBA Castlevanias and SOTN. Whereas _Hollow Knight_ did a more "expand on
the broken mould" game, _TimeSpinner_ is more "tribute to it."  I wrote [about
these games earlier this year.][2]

### Honorable Mention: Curse of the Moon

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2019/6/curse_of_the_moon_THUMB.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Curse of the Moon." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

The last thing I'll say: as a backer incentive, the Kickstarter for ROTN also
produced a tribute game called _Curse of the Moon_, which is more an homage to
pre-SOTN Castlevania. Curse is a delightful tribute to a certain kind of
side-scroller, and it cross-pollinates with RotN very well. I like [this
writeup of it][9].

(The harder difficulties are a bit more in the style of [Volgarr the Viking][8],
which I absolutely don't recommend it casually!)

My favorite example of this idea, which belongs in its own blog post, is Dota 2:
it had to be accessible to existing Dota players, but it couldn't infringe on
Blizzard's intellectual property. The problem was that all of Dota _was_ built
on Blizzard's IP since they were using Warcraft III models. So Dota 2 heroes all
_look a lot like Warcraft heroes_ but each design is a case-by-case example of
some designer getting as close as possible to a line without crossing it.
