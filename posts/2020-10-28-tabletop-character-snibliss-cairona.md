I'm in another D&D game! I'm not sure how long this one will last, but here's a
character write-up for it. Meet Snibliss, a gnome barbarian.

### Backstory

</div>

Blippen and Jomwup Cairona celebrated the birth of their daughter Galmet by
finally taking the plunge on their dream: to live by the sea, relocating to the
port town of [Loda][4]. They were translators, working contracts for
various gnome businesses trying to get straight with their documentation in the
Loda courts, specializing in Dwarvish, Orcish, and Elven. Like most gnomes, they
were a happy, jolly sort, relishing most of what life gave them, and Galmet was
a happy girl, though not as able to learn languages as her parents hoped.

One weekend, the family booked some weekend leisure: a three hour tour on a
ship around various islands near Loda. The ship was attacked by mermen, who
slaughtered everyone on the ship except Galmet, who took a harpoon and hid until
most of them jumped back into the sea. When only a few mermen remained to pick
at the scraps, she emerged, a ball of fury and passion, killing them with her
harpoon. It was her first rage, a spike of power followed by the most powerless
she'd ever felt in her short life.

She spent almost a week adrift at sea, eating seaweed, fish, some provisions
found on the ship, and though she told nobody, some of the bodies. Emaciated and
hopeless, the floating remains of the boat were boarded six days after the
attack by a pirate ship she'd later call home, _The Filthy Insanity_. A tiefling
was part of the boarding crew, and he was obviously the captain. She'd learn his
name to be Revus the Hideous. She lay hiding with her harpoon again.

She got a good stabbing on a few of his crewmates before they subdued her.
Revus asked her what happened but she was too feral to answer. She repeatedly
demanded passage to Loda.

> "No can do, miss; we're not welcome there. Work on the ship, you may
> eventually earn a dinghy to visit."
>
> "‚Ä¶but I‚Ä¶ I don't‚Ä¶ I can't‚Ä¶"
>
> "What, sail? Well then you'd better learn, shouldn't ya?! Don't worry, we'll
> toss ya overboard if you get too useless."
>
> "My name‚Äî"
>
> "Snibliss. I like Snibliss, the only gnome name I know. And now it's you! Come
> on, come aboard, you'll be useless until we feed ya."

"Snibliss" spent years on that ship, working up the "debt" for a dinghy to sail
to Loda. Her diminutive stature got them out of jams, and Revus and the crew
found her a formidable force in combat, especially when she got mad. They never
worried "if" she'd rage, it was always a "when." When Snibliss raged, it was
against the merfolk, the subsequent hunger, to a despair that never left.

After a few years, Revus gave her the dinghy. She sailed to Loda and found
it was devastating ‚Äî familiar, but also unchanged. Her whole life was
crushed, she was renamed and remade, but everyone in this town acted like none
of it mattered. Because it didn't, not to most of them. She started a few bar
fights, asked a few questions, and learned that the mermen attack was
orchestrated by a group of fixers: it wasn't a random robbery, someone wanted
that boat slaughtered, and hired some Lodans to arrange it. They didn't reveal
their employer, and Loda's authorities found a couple dozen heads floating in
port the next day.

She spent the next few years in and out of Lodan prisons, mostly for starting
fights or taking risky contract work. She never visits her childhood
institutions or acquaintances; she feels unrecognizable, and afraid of the anger
flaring when (not if, when) they let her down. A few years into this life, she
gets bailed out of jail again with a message: "Retired in Kralkukh. Come visit.
R Hideous."

She makes the journey and found Revus relaxed, a little fatter, and sipping a
drink. He tells her he always wished she'd sailed back to _The Filthy Insanity._
Talks about how proud he is of her, and urges her to explore the world and seek
what she's missing rather than stay in Loda. He gives her the most valuable
treasure he'd acquired: a _belt of giant strength._ And a starting point, an
invitation to an event he received:

> "It's a ball for accomplished fancy people. They've heard of my exploits, but
> I've no patience for it; you know I'd always prefer a rowdy cockatrice fight.
> Please, go in my place."

He looked at her a bit longer, with a hint of sadness, when he added:

> "Tell them you're my daughter."

### Aesthetics, detail

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/10/rock.jpg" alt="Rock, from Soul Calibur." style="margin: 15px auto;" />
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Rock, from Soul Calibur, wears a great animal skull, and I was thinking Snibliss could have an anglerfish thing like this happening.</p>
</div>

Snibliss has a kit themed around pirate life and sailing, so:

- Fish bones everywhere.
- Netting, seaweed.
- Unkempt hair and teeth. Leg hair, armpit hair.
- Smells of the sea.
- Eats fish, loves "improvised" meals (e.g. moonshine is more comforting than wine).

Her frame is also (obviously) large and muscular, though she's just over 3 feet
tall.

She uses harpoons as missile weapons (mechanically, javelins) and an anchor with
a short chain as a melee (mechanically, a maul).

Our DM gave us some allowance for magical items (we're starting at 8th level,
thus, the _belt of giant strength_); one that I gave her was an [immovable
rod][9]. In my head, when she fights, she "sets" the rod to take space above her
head and fights around it, so Medium and larger creatures have an extra obstacle
that she doesn't.

---

I mentioned acquaintances and social ties, the main two I were thinking of are:

- A "country club for the good gnomes of Loda"-type establishment, where her
  parents enrolled her in snooty gnome cotillion classes.

- A languages tutor she had as a child, so she could also be a translator (a
  failed endeavor; her Intelligence score is 10 lol).

### Where she came from

I've now made [a bunch of these characters][3], and when invited to this game, I
paged through the Player's Handbook and didn't feel anything particularly
calling me. But "gnome barbarian" stuck! It just felt fresh. Additionally, this
game is with a group of fairly refined players, I was tempted to introduce some
chaos.

After I had a chuckle, I remembered: my former DM (of [Homage's game][2]) played
a gnome barbarian! Shout out to _Segomar,_ who "did not take shit and could
put his money where his mouth is." Snibliss is thematically a bit different, but
Segomar laid some groundwork for me.

### Influences

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Tidehunter, from DOTA 2, carries an anchor around for a melee weapon and I think that's pretty rad.</p>
</div>

The "three hour tour" feels obvious lol, but now that I'm working with a bunch
of Zoomers, I feel compelled to explain my "obvious" references. This is
[Gilligan's Island][5].

The "lost at sea" segment came to me from _Life of Pi._

When workshopping this with Karen, I often said that _The Filthy Insanity_ aren't
_Pirates of the Caribbean_ pirates ‚Äî "plucky and fun, but not really evil!" No,
these people do murders. They're a family, but in the way many
gangs/cartels/organized crime syndicates are families.

Revus reminds me of [Yondu from _Guardians of the Galaxy_][1], playing a dad to
Starlord, and using the line "he might have been your father, but he wasn't your
daddy."

The "cotillion for gnomes" was inspired, in part, by learning about [Jack and
Jill clubs][6] and seeing country clubs play a role in _Cobra Kai_.

I imagine Snibliss's language tutor showing up in increasinly weird places and
recognizing her in her adventures, a bit like [Pavel in the _Professor Layton
games._][7] I'd imagine they're in, idk, a [Rakshasa][10] lair, about to face off
against the head, when an elf is stumbling out of the hallway saying
(in broken Dwarvish) "excuse me, I've become lost, where can I find‚Ä¶ oh,
Galmet!?  What are you doing here?"

### Playing Snibliss

A character I wrote up but didn't get to actually _play_ much was
[Ralmahant][8], my little wizard badger. The party and campaign fell through as
personal life sabotaged our DM (D&D, like polyamory, promises to be a
life of wild fun adventure, but in practice is a ton of Google Calendars).
Ral had a very toppy, high-status energy I don't normally give my characters,
I'm excited to see if Snibliss can be steered this way. It'll come from
somewhere else: Ral is a bit of a nutbar and came from wealth, Snibliss is more
premised on martial power reckless disregard for the very structure that makes
Ral feel powerful.

The poor campaign for [Sioqur][11] seems also benched for a bit, and besides
Snibliss he's one of the only _hitters_ I've made. So in a sense, I'm getting to
reprise some themes of characters I never got to shake out like I wanted.
