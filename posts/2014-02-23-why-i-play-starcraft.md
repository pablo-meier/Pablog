    Title: Why I Play StarCraft

Last year my cousin Diego posted a Facebook status along the lines of "dude...
I'm actually liking Chipotle! What's happening to me?" to which I responded
"Diego, my love for Chipotle has lasted longer than all my relationships
combined. Get with the program."

Yesterday, Blizzard's [StarCraft Facebook page][1] shared this video with the
heading "Why do YOU play StarCraft?":

And, well, I've been playing StarCraft for well over 3 years now, and streaming
for almost that long. Here's an old [vintage clip][2] from at least two years
ago, and a [more recent one][3] from last week. I've visibly aged between the
two clips; I've also gotten much better at StarCraft.

Blizzard's post got me wondering -- why _do_ I play StarCraft? Why have I stuck
with it for this long?

I think the embedded video above is a bit more romantic, but I have some ideas.

My girlfriend [Charly][4] runs half-marathons, and hopes to train for a full
one. She said something about races that I liked: while you're ostensibly racing
against other people, you're really just racing against yourself. Almost nobody
is _shocked_ by how well or poorly they do in a race, nor do they say ["I'd
rather die than lose."][17]

Usually, people know about what time range they will clock in at, and while
they're always aware of other racers, it's really about _them_ and their
performance.

StarCraft has been like that to me. Every game is a chance to push yourself
further, see how well you can do, and test whether or not you've appropriately
learned from the your collective games. In part due to the excellent matchmaking
system, every time I hit Find Match I know I'm in for a challenge to a craft I'm
practicing.

Musical instruments never really stuck with me, and traditional sports had too
much of their results tied to athleticism I didn't naturally possess (and, at
the time when I played them, didn't have the maturity to push myself to improve).
StarCraft and other competitive games are the closest thing I've had to a practiced
craft that wasn't also my job.

Jazz (or Classical) is rarely interesting for the composition being played, but
how it's being played. Jazz musicians know about 200 "standards," and audiences
don't get tired of them because they know that _these_ musicians on _this_ day
play it in a way that will never be repeated exactly.

StarCraft games, after you've passed the "discovery phase" and learned the
various units and their abilities, follow a similar vein: it's very likely that
in a Terran vs. Zerg, the Terran player will go [bio/mine after a hellion opening][5]
and the Zerg will go for [a ling/bane/muta midgame][6] (there are deviations, of
course, but not often). Knowing this doesn't make it any less interesting to
watch: seeing how it goes down _this time_ between _these players_ gives you
something to chew on.

Most people scoff (and not entirely without reason) at the title "eSports," but
they do share this quality with traditional sports: watching it go down is where
the fun is. We all know in football that you'll probably run the ball on a 3rd
and short. But will it succeed? Could it be a fake since the defense knows this
too? StarCraft, Dota, and others, are my preferred [weighted random number
generator][7].

Never mind the drama that comes from any competitive endeavor shared by a
community: see [this amazing post][8] by a hardcore [_Spelunky_][9] fan on what
it means to truly "beat the game," or more recently, [millions of people trying
to play Pokemon together][10]. It's entertaining.

And as with pro sports, there are personalities involved. [This gif][16] of MVPKeen
winning a match got popular on the General Person Internet for a while. And below
is a compilation video of one of the better narratives in StarCraft, which was
[FruitDealer][14]'s run through the first GSL:

(overwrought, but man it was thrilling to see it happen live)

Finally, there are ups and there are downs, and for whatever's going on, I've
got StarCraft. It reminds me of a rant Jimmy Fallon's character from
[_Fever Pitch_][11] gives during the "conflict phase" of that Rom-Com:

> Ben: Why? I'll tell you why, 'cause the Red Sox never let you down.
>
> Troy: Huh?
> 
> Ben: That's right. I mean - why? Because they haven't won a World Series in a
> century or so? So what? They're here. Every April, they're here. At 1:05 or at
> 7:05, there is a game. And if it gets rained out, guess what? They make it up to
> you. Does anyone else in your life do that? The Red Sox don't get divorced. This
> is a real family. This is the family that's here for you. 

Truth is, I can play when times are good, and more importantly, I can play when
times are bad. When [the depression][12] hits, StarCraft keeps my brain busy
enough to distract it from attacking me, and I can play for as long as I need to
recover. I'm not the only one who used StarCraft to [get through tough times][13],
but I love that I can.

I may not always play StarCraft (I've been cheating on it a lot lately to play
and follow competitive [Dota 2][15]), but it's been a great 3 years :)
