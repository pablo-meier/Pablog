    og_description: A latin ballad, my extremely profitable product, words.

<small>ðŸŽµ <em>The song for this post is the one embedded below.</em> ðŸŽµ</small>

Alright I overloaded on music videos last time, but this song knocked my socks
off when YouTube autoplayed it. I lost concentration on my code and just
alt-tabbed to be like "aaaaAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!" If you're a Spanish-speaker, do
give it a listen to the end!

Grateful to my parents and grandparents for playing all sorts of great music
in the house growing up ðŸ˜„

### Amado milestone

I don't actively work on [Amado ðŸ’Œ][1], but people still talk and hear about it,
and once in a while someone wants to make one. Today a friend not only launched
their campaign, but _paid for it._ Amado is now a few billion dollars more
profitable than Slack, Uber, Lyft, and Peloton _combined._ ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°

Sometimes I'm tempted to put in the last 20-30 hours over a month or two that it
would take to make it more robust and less embarassing, usable without
handholding; but it's a bit hard to find the time and energy (startup hustle!
pandemic!), and I'm having much more fun on [silly OCaml than][2] than, like, a
_product._

But! Reminder that I'm here to handhold anyone through making a campaign if
you'd like. You can pay what you like (which can be nothing, or better yet,
**donate**); it's a lot more about mission to me, and I get thrilled thrilled
thrilled when people use it to make a gift for someone they love.

### Programmers and "simple"

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<img src="/img/2020/3/inigo.jpg" alt="Inigo Mantoya saying the line &quot;You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.&quot;" style="margin: 15px auto;" />
</div>

I'm trying out [Alcotest][3] for my OCaml bot, and the README says:

> Alcotest exposes simple interface to perform unit tests. It exposes a simple
> `TESTABLE` module type, a `check` function to assert test predicates and a run
> function to perform a list of `unit -> unit` test callbacks.

Now, listen. Did you have to write "simple" twice in two sentences?

**Simple doesn't mean anything,** other than "I like it this way," or "it makes
sense to me, right now, with low effort." That last one is usually often because
"I wrote it!" also applies. It's become such a thing that I reflexively hiss
when I see it in READMEs.

Now's a good time to re-link the [Devil's Dictionary of Programming][4], with
definitions like:

> framework â€” A product with the business logic removed, but all of the
> assumptions left in.
