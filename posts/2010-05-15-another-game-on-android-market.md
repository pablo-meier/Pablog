[My games group][1] is happy and proud to release Momenta (development title
[Platformer][2]) to the Market today!

<!-- more -->

As with [my first Market release][5], you can [click here][6] if you're
browsing from an Android phone, or search "Momenta" in the Android Market.

What would you pay for this [Eyjafjallajokull][9] eruption of fun? You might
say $10,000, but wait, it's free! Download it, PLAY IT, enjoy it, and please
provide feedback!
