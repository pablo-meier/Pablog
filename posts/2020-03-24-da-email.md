    og_description: Consider a local client for email! Or Migadu, if hosting your own sucks.

Nick Heer over at Pixel Envy [remarks on how much he enjoys Apple Mail][1],
while linking to [this feature retrospective by a dev on it][2], in particular,
its management of many inboxes:

> Iâ€™ve tried probably half a dozen alternative email clients over the years, but
> I keep coming back to Appleâ€™s on MacOS and iOS. One reason has been its

I'll just take this opportunity to remind you: you can use desktop mail clients!
They're fun! I switched to [Thunderbird][3] recently and largely love it: I also
have unified email addresses between my GMail, my `@morepablo.com` mail, and
`@amado.app` mails. [K-9 Mail][4] on Android does similarly well, though for my
GMails I use the GMail Android app since it is slightly better integrated with
Google Calendar and the rest of GSuite, which my company uses.

Besides unified inboxes, I also configured Thunderbird to send plaintext email
and block remote content, so I don't trigger tracking pixels. You get some great
alt text this way, and I enable network requests on per-message basis.

I mentioned in my [self-hosting post][17] that my own mail server was a bit of a
Final Boss of self-hosting; while I could follow a postfix/dovecot tutorial, I
kept trying to actually understand the moving parts and get the ability to
modify them if needed (e.g. OpenLDAP authentication). So I died to the boss, and
while I grind levels on the skills required, am hosting my email on [Migadu][6].

Migadu is _great._ Like other software I've plugged recently ([GoatCounter][15],
[SourceHut][16]) it's built and run according to what I consider healthy software
standards: respect for users, transparency, thin clients, sustainable business
vs. VC-Take-Over-The-World. If you've got domain names and would like to
receive emails to those domain names in a cheap, super-simple way, I suggest
giving them a look!

Other links on email:

**`mutt`** is the granddaddy of tech flexes, imo. I often state that I learned
vim not because I felt limited by text editing, but because it looked _so damn
cool_ to see the cursor jump around over the shoulders of others and I wanted to
be the guy who could do that; there's a similar level of envy for power mutt
users. It's notoriously hard to set up, but there are guides. Also, I just
learned of [neomutt][7], which looks like fun.

In the continuing quest of "a Jedi builds their own lightsaber," Drew DeVault
built and maintains **[`aerc`][8].** Drew is heavily invested in email: he built
SourceHut around it, wrote [a great and practical guide][9] on to how to use
email as your way of managing Open Source contributions (as designed by Linus in
git for Linux), and [this set of recs][10] for email the way he likes it, likely
a byproduct of his tech preferences and how much he works with mailing lists to
manage projects and community. `aerc` looks solid, if specific to a certain dev
workflow in SourceHut.

If you want to flex but the above is far too conventional, consider
[`qmail`][11]. It's written by a guy who definitely had a bit of a cult (maybe
still, I haven't followed) for what was perceived to be godly design and coding
powers (I haven't verified one way or the other â€” just looked at the writing and
was like "wow! cult"). I skimmed it a decade ago, realized I was far out of my
league in knowing anything about mail and delivery, and backed away. You might
find something fun here? He also got a bit of press when someone discovered [his
notes on a build system][12], wrote [a viral post about it][14], and
eventually [wrote a version of it.][13]
