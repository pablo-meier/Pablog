It's my birthday! I might write a more reflective post or something, but instead
I'll just publish this, which I've been chipping away at for a while. Here are
things I've read or played!

### Brass

I read this book almost a year ago. It's alright! I wouldn't peg it as a
must-read, but you could do a lot worse.

In the world of NYT Bestseller listings for fiction, a certain type of work gets
overrepresented. It's usually written by a serious-looking White Dude about
Serious White Dudes dealing with aging by fucking a younger women
with delicate bones. It's written _ponderously_. Even the young White dudes who
break into this, a least ~a decade ago (Jonathan Safran Foer, Dave Eggers)
tend to write like they were wearing a sweater-vest at a typewriter the whole
time.

I imagine some of the praise this book gets is from a sense of voyuerism by people
steeped in the above: this book has capital-I Immigrants! People in poverty with
no chances for upward social mobility! It feels gritty!

So I'm trying to be mindful of the above and not fall into the trap of
exotifying it inappropriately by saying it was very satisfying to read, in part
for the novelty of those elements, at least to me. I haven't read many stories
taking place around Albanian immigrant communities. When I see something this
unfamiliar, reminds me of how little I see Guatemalan stories, and I root harder
for them. I like a sympathetic character who's been failed by our social
systems. I like that not every story about non-rich people is a _Blind Side_
story of golden hearts prevailing.  People are all over, and they've got
stories. I also really appreciated the voices of the narrators, and the
compositional choice of the ending. I hope this author keeps putting them out.

### Jessica Jones S3

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

_Jessica Jones_ was always the best Netflix Marvel series, and the only one to
get to 3 seasons before Netflix cancelled it, because capitalism can't let good
things last. Netflix no longer tweaks its algorithms to deliver you content you
love, but to keep you watching as long as possible, which is a subtle but
important distinction: before they were trying to touch the ceiling, now they
just want to avoid the floor. Their CEO once said ["sleep is their competition,"][3]
which I find pretty harrowing. And now that they're in the content
creation game, they tweak the [algorithms for new user acquisition][4] over
current-user satisfaction, so they've decided the optimal number of seasons for
getting _new_ people on the platform isâ€¦ two.

(that's not the only reason: new work is hungry for exposure over something
that's proven its value, so it's cheaper. The cast of _Friends_ weren't
making a million dollars per episode in the first two years).

That's likely not what killed _Jessica,_ though: now that millenials are hitting
their 40's and we're _finally_ getting trickles of our own wealth (and enough
Boomers are starting to die, I guess?), business trends are finally focusing their
efforts on and seriously investing in products around our habits. That means streaming
video over the internet, now that cable is another industry we're "killing" (most
things we've killed are because [we're fucking broke][10], at least until the
Boomers die _en masse_ and bequeath all that wealth they're hoarding _en masse_
into mostly-White people who'll be the next generation of Republicans, who'll
wonder why everyone else is complaining so much when it worked out for _them_).
Anyways, Disney is taking its properties off of Netflix and will presumably milk
exclusivity for Disney+.

What does this mean for me? [Piracy is back, baby][5]. With all the self-hosted
bullshit and open Internet I'm trying to contribute to and feed myself, I'll be
doing my damndest not to subscribe to 11 disparate services for one show each.

Sorry! Digression! This is about _Jessica Jones_ S3. It's fine! Not the
strongest JJ. Season 1 was hard to top, Season 2 took a compositional risk on
its villain, which I really appreciated, but this one didn't add much to what
the other two seasons already brought to the table, in my opinion.

### Ori and the Blind Forest

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

This was fun! For my tastes, the aesthetics were a bit twee and I felt the
soundtrack was overwrought, but as far as Metroidvanias go it was pretty
satisfying. I weirdly appreciate how they straight-up opted out of a combat
system â€” there's no real "aiming," you just mash the attack button when someone
is nearby and it'll shock them.

It's mostly a platformer, and I think some of its mechanics are pretty novel
(the badly-named ["Bash"][6] skill is extremely fun, and haven't seen something
_quite_ like it in other games). I'm not super-motivated to go back and go full
completionist, but I'll recommend it on the basis of a few of its dungeons,
which are best-in-class.

As much as it has a story, I found it weak. It was a tribute to aesthetics,
which aren't nothing! But this isn't my aesthetic. There's also some attempts to
redeem the main antagonist in a weird way, and I think the urge to have no real
villains feels out of place.

### American Vandal, Seasons 1 and 2

</div>

This may be one of my favorite shows in recent memory. Using a pastiche of a
problematic genre to tell these stories (which are great stories touching on a
lot of themes!) works exceptionally well. The craft is out-of-this world: the
actors kill it, and the writing is spectacular, both in the technique and also
the composition.

Like a lot of things I like, I regret to say it's backloaded: while the first
episode or two of either season is entertaining enough, the show _really_ gets
good as more of the cast is introduced, and the finale of both seasons packs a
wallop.

### Superior

Part of the _Flash Forward_ book club (about which I've written posts for the
other [books][7] [we've][8] [read][9]), this one has the unlucky distinction of
being read mostly on an elliptical since I lost my headphones, so I wasn't
taking notes as carefully as the others, nor was I as good at retaining what I
read. That said, I rather liked it!

It should surprise no one that I think race science is hot garbage, but this
account of its history and why it keeps poking its head was still enlightening.
I know a bit more about biology and genetics, at least at a very high level,
than I did before. I feel a bit more complicated about some historical ideas
than I did before. I wouldn't call the writing _thrilling_, but not boring? It
moves, but it doesn't push.

### Shovel Knight

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

Piece-wise, there's a lot about this that I liked! But on the whole, I can't
say this cake came together for me.

On one hand: the soundtrack! Oh my God! It's **so** good; while most games with
pixel art have to make hard choices about how "authentically" to score
themselves, I don't think I've hit a soundtrack that absolutely nailed the line
between "sounds like a real game from that time period" while also breaking a
few rules to sound so palateable to a modern ear.

Additionally: the little writing there is, it's delightful. The Shovel Knight's
inherent Lawful Good-ness, the amount of character they pack into the rival
knights, the shovel puns that open each level; it's all exceptionally executed.

But the game itself, I didn't strictly love playing. In my head, I _think_ I
like the brutal platforming mechanics of the old Mega Man games, but in
practice, I like them to be a little more forgiving. There were some obstacles
that made me say "oh, that's a _helper_ obstacle" (an example of what I mean is
about 9 seconds into [this timestamped video][1]) This got pretty stressful near
the end! Many of the platforming challenges felt like a big Fuck You, and I'm
playing this _while_ collecting Goldens in _Celeste._

You could do much worse, and I'm happy for having played it. But while I've gone
back to many games that have pushed me (_The Messenger_, a few times now) I
don't know when I'll make a return here.

(that soundtrack, though)

### Dicey Dungeons

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">

</div>

[_Super Hexagon_][2] took me absolutely by surprise; it was a fantastic little
masochism machine for my poor brain to chew on during one of the most depressed
periods of my life. One of the highlights was its soundtrack, so when I heard
its creator and composer were back for another, _of course_ I'm going to get it.

Every review of this game starts with "well, indie dice-based Roguelikes are a
dime a dozen now,â€¦" and, like, are they? I'll take your word for it, but I don't
play enough games (and I play a lot, I think!) to feel this way.

It's fun! It does a fantastic job of introducing new mechanics with the various
characters to make it feel fresh (favorite is the witch, though the robot and
inventor are also fantastic). It takes the a lot of great elements of dice
probability and deckbuilding. I don't think I'll finish it (there are many
levels, and it's pretty challenging!) but I'm happy to have played it, and
[Chipzel's score][11]. Is. SO GOOD. I've been listening to it continuously while
coding this week, it's just fantastic.
