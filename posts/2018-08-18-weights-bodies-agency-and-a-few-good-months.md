    og_description: I lost some weight after making some changes, rather happy with it.

<small><em>The song for this post is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DekTSh1QmvY">Circus Galop</a>, composed for player pianos by Marc-AndrÃ© Hamelin.</em></small>

Few things are as affecting to a person than their relationship to their body,
and by extension there are few more significant narratives in society than
body size, shape, and weight loss. Someone in your life (likely at least a few)
struggles or has struggled with disordered eating. When I talk about body and
weight, I don't mean tread lightly on what is a deep and loaded topic.

With that in mind, I've taken a few initiatives that I'm happy with regarding
how I see my body. For the last three months, I've made some alterations to my
lifestyle and lost about 30 pounds. I'll be detailing what I've done (and
continue to be doing), and some surrounding context. You can jump
right to <a href="#pablo-side">what I'm doing</a>, or <a href="#context">the
surrounding context</a>. Naturally I'd be delighted if you read both, but
realistically most people will have a lot more interest in one more than the
other.

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

### Bodies, shaming, patriarchy

**Fat shaming is unabashed bullshit.** Being fat or thin, like being tall or
short, or having a certain color of hair, is a property of someone's meat vessel
at a particular point in time and not a meaningful window into anything
interesting about that person.

All other meat-vessel-property context still applies: a person can apply
agency on it (you may not choose your face or height, but you can choose your
haircut, wear makeup or stylish clothes, etc.), those avenues of agency are also
complicated and frequently connected to privilege (makeup is expensive, time to
invest is easier or harder to find), and any judgement of meat-vessel-properties
is usually rife with bugs and largely a reflection of the biases and ignorances
of the person judging.

Fat people are hit especially hard by this: any photo of a fat person online
gets commented on by awful humans, there are entire website dedicated to hating
on them. It's culturally acceptable for people to react to fat bodies with
performative disgust, which is a silly and hurtful thing to do about someone's
body.

I'm not the person best-equipped to write about this in-depth; I recommend Lindy
West and/or Melissa McEwan. Just want to state my intentions around and
awareness of this horseshit before going into my last three months, since wanting
and subsequently choosing to lose weight isn't a neutral decision.

### Calories in, Calories Out

The basis of my changes have involved diet and exercise. These topics are very
loaded, and the science behind bodies and weight loss is in flux and frequently
contested.

I really appreciated [this video][3] on the value of exercise as it relates to
weight loss, especially in the long term (spoiler alert: it's highly overstated).
There's also [great research on how "calories in/calories out"][4] is an uphill
climb as a lifelong strategy. This isn't simple.

### Of course it's fucking capitalism

If you do nothing else, you'll want to read [Body Positivity is a Scam][1].

Done that? Great! You probably know that I attribute many of society's largest
ills to how I've observed capitalism practiced in my lifetime. Why are we taking
in so many bad calories? Did you see [how much our government is trying to put
cheese into everything we eat][22], to subsidize farmers who made so much useless
cheese? Hey, [the soda industry is worth at least $20 billion dollars][23], the
[snack food market is $47b][24]. There is money to be made in selling us crap.

In the spirit of "invent a disease, sell the cure" it's also a fact that
[weight loss is a $68b industry.][25] I suspect this overlaps significantly with
[the $80b fitness industry.][26]

### All this to say

My favorite line after the 2008 bailouts is "we privatized the gains
and socialized the losses"; a few assholes got very rich ruining our futures,
pensions, and the economy, and we all had to pay for it out of our taxes.

A similar thing happens with a lot of culture in late capitalism: a
comparably small number of people get very rich paying off a couple thousand
policymakers and subordinates to create this system where no single person is
accountable, or even technically doing anything outright evil, but the results 
in aggregate are a sick society that hates themselves, their bodies, and fights
uphill for their entire life to find relief they're structurally prevented from
finding. Very smart people spend their entire professional lives trying to make
numbers on a spreadsheet go green, but the impact this has on the real world is
stuff like corn syrup being in everything.

I'll never tell someone to "love your body"; given all the above, how could you
expect that of anyone? And what would it even mean to do so when "loving" it
usually means winning an unfair game, at the expense of other people? What I can
say, a bit more safely, is _own your relationship with your body._ If you want
to love it, determine exactly what this means to you specifically. From there
you will be empowered to make choices towards that end. 

<h2 id="pablo-side">What I've been doing</h2>

<small>(Disclaimer that I'm able to do a lot of this because I have a fair bit of
disposable income working as a software engineer.)</small>

### Counting calories

The main impetus that got me started on this were two posts from Matt Might: [one
on weight loss,][5] and [one on gaining strength.][6] His posts are very
practically-minded, explaining the thinking behind his steps and how he achieved
them, I found them to be excellent places to start.

A goal for this process: I want to look like Chris Hemsworth dancing in
_Ghostbusters_.

To do this, I'd need low body fat but still have significant muscle mass. Since
I have pretty high body fat and low muscle mass, I'm starting with weight loss
while preserving as much lean mass as I can, then I plan to bulk up in the Fall
months. After that, another cut around Winter.

At a high level:

* I pick a direction for my weight: lose, gain, or maintain. I've been at "lose"
  for three months.

* I track calories and eat toward that goal.

* In order to maximize lean mass and minimize fat, whichever direction I'm moving:
  - Make sure I get enough protein in my diet.
  - Try to do resistance training (weight lifting) regularly.

* Do many cardio workouts. While this gives me extra calorie budget while
  losing weight, the primary reason I do it is for health benefits that keep me
  happy and motivated throughout the process.

### Tracking

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">My theme for this year is "marathon, not sprint." Tracking helps me keep my eye on the prize!</p>
</div>

I have a [FitBit Charge 2][7], and I track calories in the Fitbit app.
Alternatives are [MyFitnessPal][8], [Google Fit][9] for Android users or
[HealthKit][10] for iOS users.

I mostly look up what I ate in their database and find the closest match. It's involves
a fair bit of approximation. Sometimes restaurants have their calorie counts
listed, and if it's a chain like Chipotle or Subway or Five Guys, they have
online calorie counters. Here was how I used [Five Guys' calorie information][11]
to build [something like a burger for 421 calories.][12]

I also track my weight in the app. I went to the Wirecutter and picked up [their
favorite "smart scale"][13] but it really suffices to log it in manually. I log a few
times a day since there's a lot of variation.

From training to be a Pon de FLO instructor and working on fitness tracking for
ClassPass, I can tell you that consumer-grade devices are horribly imprecise,
and the data you get from them are a proxy of a proxy of a proxy. But it helps me
set intention, and as long as it's wrong in a _consistent_ way I still get value
out of it.

### Moving more (cardio)

</a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">Taking a lot more classes</p>
</div>

My last gig before Lyft was [ClassPass][14], which put in something of an advantage in
knowing about studio fitness in NYC. Here are studios I've tried and have
reactions to, if you have zero interest in NYC studio fitness, scroll down:

* [Peloton][16] is my favorite spin class. I like most of the instructors, it's pretty
  posh (willing to bet the in-studio experience is a loss leader, their _real_
  business is the bike sales), and the classes don't have silly bouncing in your
  chair. It's near my office and I can normally find class I like.

* [Flywheel][17] is right next to my office. It's got silly chair bouncing, but I
  still get good workouts and can't beat the convenience, especially with
  ClassPass's monthly limits.

* [KORE][15] is a solid HIIT class, near my office, usually with space. I worry
  sometimes about injury, since sometimes they'll do reasonably sophisticated
  movements without a lot of explanations (Romanian Deadlifts come to mind) and
  it's enough weight that you can't call it a rest day if you've done
  resistance training recently, but the instructors are attentive and I make
  modifications as necessary.

* I have mixed feelings about [ConBody][18]'s branding, but it is a hell of a workout.
  I soak through whatever I'm wearing and I love that it's all bodyweight.
  Main thing keeping me from going more frequently is that it's not near where I
  work.

Zumba! I still **love** dance fitness more than any other workout.
Unfortunately, NYC eats Zumba instructors: previous favorite classes are not
unavailable. That said, I've never had a bad class with [Z Club NY][19], which has
classes in Upper West Side, Upper East Side, and SoHo. None are convenient
locations, but when I need to dance I'll make it happen. I've taken classes with
Anna, Volha, Mario, and Guillermo and they've all been fabulous.

What happened to [Pon de FLO][20]? The studio closed. They still have classes a few
times a week. It's a great workout but I haven't been able to incorporate it.

### Worktime walks

<div class="caption-img-block" style="margin: 25px auto">
<a href="/img/2018/8/Screenshot_20180816-190957.png" target="blank">
<img src="/img/2018/8/Screenshot_20180816-190957_THUMB.png" alt="CityMapper helps make long walks fun. Click for full size." style="margin: 15px auto; max-width: 50%" />
</a>
<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: small">CityMapper helps make long walks fun.</p>
</div>

I learned a friend of mine walked _3 hours_ to work every day. When I heard
this, I figured why not try this myself? When possible, I walk to and from work.
It's about 80 minutes.

This is a real investment, but I'm loving it. It's time to myself. I listen to
podcasts and audiobooks. I cross the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge once or twice a
day. It's as much for clearing my head as it is for the calorie benefit.

### What's next?

I'd like to get into a stretching routine: I've never put much attention to
flexibility and think it would do me well, especially if I keep dancing.

I bought some new clothes. That was fun.

After I hit my next target weight, I think I'll start gaining; I'd like a bit
more muscle mass.

I might finally get that tattoo. I've had a few ideas but I've held off for
years because I didn't like the body it would be on. I'm a lot more at peace
with it, not because there's less of it, but because I feel more connected to
it; that I'm glad it's my partner rather than just beholden to it.

## Lastly

One of my favorite articles this year was [this analysis/monument to a blog post
about one woman's wedding preparations to be her most glammed self.][21]
You should read it. What comes to mind is this notion that _wow this game is
terrible and rigged_ but also _yo I want to win this game._

After a few years of therapy I'm trying to exercise more agency in my life. I
feel like I have a lot of issues owning that I want things and subsequently
putting myself on the line to reach them.  I'm happy with the progress of this
recent initiative, here's hoping I continue to get as much out of it ðŸ˜„
